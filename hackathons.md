Welcome to the MakerDAO Hackathons Initiative: A place where organizers can get the information they need to include MakerDAO in their hackathons and where hackers can find the developer resources they need to build thier projects.

## Project Snapshot

- Build for DeFi
- Earn bounties in Dai
- Find the resources you need
- Solve problems

## What are we trying to accomplish?

[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) is a decentralised organization that brings stability to the crypto economy through Dai, the world's first decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is a secure, transparent, censorship-resistant programmable money that is the perfect building block for many emerging use-cases on the blockchain.

We believe that the future is decentralized and that you can make it real by building with Dai. By participating in, sponsoring, and organizing hackathons the Maker Foundation hopes to strengthen the developer community and push the limits of what can be built around MakerDAO and Dai.

## Project Description

The Maker Foundation is involved in hackathons in many ways:

- Sponsor prizes
- Come up with hackathon themes and tracks
- Participate as judges and mentors
- Enroll hackathon participants and winners into our [Grants program](grantsmd)

## Is this for me?

### Developer

- Passion for programmable money
- Skills in various languages like Javascript, Solidity, or React
- Excitement to build and be recognized

### Organizer

- Track record of successful hackathons
- Community excited to build with Dai
- Desire to help build the future of finance
