Organizing a successful event requires some effort. We've put together some guidelines to help you through this process.

Below are the first steps for organizing an event:

- Put together a clearly outlined [agenda](./event-formats-guide.md)
- Create a [budget](./budget-guide.md)
- Find a location and time for the event
- Prepare a plan for [promoting](./promotion-guide.md) your event
- Prepare a plan for recording and sharing presentations from the event

## Best Practices

- Plan on paper before doing anything else.
- Find a handful of people that are willing to help you with the event.
- Start with a hypothetical budget, and update it as you lock things in.
- When securing a location, always ask for a breakdown of available equipment.
- Consider your audience and plan the meetup in a way that fits them.
- Be the catalyst and facilitator, not the featured speaker at every meeting (people will get tired of you if you do.)
- Do your best to get people from outside the people who usually attend your meetings to present.
- Include information about the speakers on your event page.
- Shake up the format. Have presentations, panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, etc.
- Set a consistent date, time, and location. Always have it there so people can get used to it.
- If at all possible, never cancel a planned meetup or many people will loose faith in your ability and stop RSVPing to your events.

## Resources

We've included several guides and also some additional resources to help you organize the event:

- [Budget Guide](./budget-guide.md)
- [Promotion Guide](./promotion-guide.md)
- [Event Formats Guide](./event-formats-guide.md)
- [Design files](https://github.com/makerdao/Overview-of-MakerDAO-design#style-guide)
- [Example Presentations](https://awesome.makerdao.com#videos)
- [Usable Slides and Presentation Decks](./assets/slides)

## Hosting the meetup

Once you have your meetup plan ready, speakers confirmed, the venue set, and the event promoted, it's time for the execution.

### On the date of the event

- Send communications to all the essential parties early in the day.
- Repeat promotional messaging across all of your channels on the day of the event.
- Read through the [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l) beforehand, so you are familiar with the various details you need to keep track of.
- Arrive at your venue early to prepare and test the equipment.
- During the introduction, describe the agenda, introduce the speakers, and talk about the key takeaways participants can expect from the event.
- Be welcoming and informative.

## Post-Event Process

As part of the requirements for getting funding approved, we require hosts to provide information about their event after-the-fact in a [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l). This helps us to better understand the impact of these events and what we can do to help make them better.

Organizers should read through the [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l) before their event so they can be prepared to answer the questions.
