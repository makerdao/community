## Who should apply for a microgrant?

The Community Development Group has allocated funds to help members of our community host local meetups. If you're a community member who is passionate about MakerDAO and Decentralized Finance, this [form](https://airtable.com/shr4HOtcZ8o3VZmek) is for you.

## Who should _not_ apply for a microgrant?
