# Poll: Parameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - August 2, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These Stability Fee and Maximum Debt Ceiling changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
