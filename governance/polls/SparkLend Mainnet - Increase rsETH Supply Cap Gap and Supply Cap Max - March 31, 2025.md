# Poll: SparkLend Mainnet - Increase rsETH Supply Cap Gap and Supply Cap Max - March 31, 2025

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.1_Operational_Weekly_Cycle-b189fa17-57a9-4d4e-9780-0ce4efd94211%7C0db30308) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 31 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the rsETH supply cap `gap` and `max` parameters on SparkLend Mainnet as follows:

- rsETh Supply Cap Parameters
  - Increase `gap` by 3,000 rsETH from 2,000 rsETH to **5,000 rsETH**.
  - Increase `max` by 20,000 rsETH from 20,000 to rsETH **40,000 rsETH**.

 The definitions for these parameters can be found [in the Atlas under 3.9, Measures For Endgame Transition - SparkLend Risk Parameters - Cap Automators](https://github.com/makerdao/next-gen-atlas/blob/7c760dc4d688220f2b954120597a69c1e108bd5a/Sky%20Atlas/Sky%20Atlas.html#L8989). Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.sky.money/t/april-3-2025-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell-2/26203) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to include this change on SparkLend Ethereum.
- This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Sky Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.9.2.1_Pause_Delay/a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0%7C0db30758e055) has expired.
