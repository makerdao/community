# Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP7c3-SP7 and MIP4c2-SP1 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

### MIP4c2-SP18: MIP7 Amendments

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Due to the expansion of the MakerDAO Core Units (CU) and the focus on crypto native and real world assets (RWA), a Domain Team is requested to be added to better support the collateral onboarding process: Collateral Engineering Services Team (CES-001).*

### MIP7c3-SP7: CES Domain Team Onboarding (CES-001)

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

_The CES Core Unit was ratified in September of 2021. Given its sole focus on collateral onboarding and maintenance, Domain Team status is recommended to officially participate in the defined MIP processes for collateral management._

_While Domain Teams predate Core Units, they are still actively used in many of the collateral MIPs. For completeness and accuracy, it is recommended to onboard the entire CES team following the [MIP7](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP7) onboarding process._
