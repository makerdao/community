# Poll: Activate the Governance Security Module for SCD - March 9, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to activate the [Governance Security Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation#1-introduction-summary) for Single Collateral Dai.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Tuesday, March 9, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, March 13, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [blog post](https://blog.makerdao.com/governance-security-module-gsm/) on December 9, 2019. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
