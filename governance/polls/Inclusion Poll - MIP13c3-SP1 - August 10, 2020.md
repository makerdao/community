# Inclusion Poll for MIP13c3-SP1 - Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance) - August 10, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the proposal(MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent: (Forward Guidance)) should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll.

If the **Yes** votes in this inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** when the poll ends, the proposal should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll. Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.

## Review

The proposal can be reviewed here: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3130. It was also mentioned and possibly discussed on the [Governance Call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3469) on August 6, 2020.

## Next Steps

If the Inclusion poll passes, the Governance Facilitator(s) will confirm the inclusion of this proposal within the next Monthly Governance Poll on the Thursday Governance and Risk call on August 13, 2020. The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP3/mip3.md).
