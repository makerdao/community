# Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund (MIP55) - July 12, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, July 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the Special Purpose Fund (MIP55) being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*A Special Purpose Fund (SPF) is used to fulfill a narrow, specific or temporary objective, where approved funds are locked in escrow, releasable by a minimum of 2/3 signers, where at least 2 signers (called Comptrollers) are mandated actors or community members appointed by mandated actors.*

* *Funding is only available in Dai.*
* *A SPF must contain one Point of Contact (from the SPF receiver) and a minimum of two Comptrollers. Comptrollers execute payouts to final recipients based on the completion of milestones stated in the SPF Scope.*
* *Any SPF requests less than 50,000 Dai can go into a weekly or signal request process, but anything greater than 50,000 Dai must go through the monthly governance cycle.*
