## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP19 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*For the DAO to grow long-term, it is critical that MKR holders be able to evaluate and compare Budget Proposals with minimum cognitive overhead. Within this revised MIP, Core Units and proposed Core Units are required to submit standardized, transparent, and clear financial information. Budget Proposals must clearly serve a revenue-driving or supporting business purpose in line with the Objectives of the DAO.*
