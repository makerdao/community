# Poll: Non-Scope Defined Parameter Changes - wstETH-B DC-IAM Changes - August 7, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
* Increase the wstETH-B [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) by 15 million DAI from 30 million DAI to **45 million DAI**.
* Reduce the wstETH-B [Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#ceiling-increase-cooldown-ttl) by 14,400 seconds from 57,600 seconds to **43,200 seconds**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-wsteth-b-dc-iam/21568) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
