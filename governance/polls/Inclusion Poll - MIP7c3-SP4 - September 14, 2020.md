# Inclusion Poll for MIP7c3-SP4 - Domain Team Onboarding (Smart Contracts) - September 14, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the proposal (MIP7c3-SP4 - Domain Team Onboarding (Smart Contracts)) should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll.

If the **Yes** votes in this inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** when the poll ends, the proposal should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll. Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.

## Review
Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/4057) to inform your position on this proposal before voting. It was also mentioned and possibly discussed on the [governance call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3971) on September 10, 2020.

## Next Steps

The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP3/mip3.md).
