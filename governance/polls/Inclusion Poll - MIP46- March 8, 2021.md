# Inclusion Poll for Parameter Proposal Groups (MIP 46) - March 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP3/mip3.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on March 8, 2021 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**
