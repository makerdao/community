# Poll: Adjust the ETH-A Debt Ceiling - August 17, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Foundation Risk Team. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the ETH-A Debt Ceiling from 340 million to 420 million.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for one day beginning on Monday, August 17 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live later this week.

## Review 

Please review the [[Discussion] ETH-A Debt Ceiling Raise](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-eth-a-debt-ceiling-raise/3701) forum thread to inform your position before voting.


## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in either in the Executive Vote on Friday, August 21 2020 or it will be included in an expedited Executive Vote prior to that time.
