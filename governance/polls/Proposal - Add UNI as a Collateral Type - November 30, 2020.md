# Poll: Add UNI (Uniswap) as a Collateral Type - November 30, 2020

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding UNI (Uniswap) as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

The proposed initial system parameters for UNI (Uniswap) are:

* Stability Fee: 3%
* Liquidation Ratio: 175%
* Debt Ceiling: 15 million DAI
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 6 hours
* Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* Dust: 500 DAI

Please review the following forum threads containing information about UNI (Uniswap) to inform your position before voting.

* [Oracles Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/uni-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment-mip10c3-sp15/5375)

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* UNI (Uniswap) will be included in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
