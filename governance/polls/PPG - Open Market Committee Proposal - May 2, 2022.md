# Poll: Rates Proposal - May 2, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [MakerDAO Open Market Committee](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following parameter changes: 

- Lower the WBTC-A [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) from 3.25% to **2.25%**.
- Lower the WBTC-B [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) from 4.5% to **4.0%**.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-28-april-2022/14863) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Friday executive passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
