# Poll: Add HTC-DROP as a new RWA Vault Type - June 7, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding HTC-DROP (Harbor Trade Credit DROP Token) as a new vault type in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

### Collateral Parameters

* [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee): 7%
* [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling): 7 million DAI*
* Minimum Vault Collateralization Ratio: 110%
* Minimum SPV Collateralization Ratio: 104%
* Minimum Underlying Collateralization Ratio: 114%
* Liquidation Process: [MIP22](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP22)

Please review the following forum threads containing information about HTC-DROP (Harbor Trade Credit DROP Token) to inform your position before voting.
* [Initial Collateral Application](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/htc-drop-mip6-application-harbor-trade-credit-drop-short-term-trade-receivables/3502)
* [Real-World Finance Core Unit Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/htc-drop-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/8001)
* [Protocol Engineering Core Unit Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa004-ht2drp-htc-drop-mip22-token-protocol-engineering-domain-team-assessment/8416)
* [Oracles Team Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-004-htc-drop-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment-mip10c3-sp30/8400)

**Initial debt ceiling will be 5 million DAI. A future executive will be submitted to raise the debt ceiling to **7 million DAI** after the addition of an independent director to the SPV or at the determination of the RWF Core Unit Facilitator.*

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* HTC-DROP (Harbor Trade Credit DROP Token) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows, **with a Debt Ceiling of 5 million DAI**. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.
* A second future executive vote will increase the Debt Ceiling to 7 million DAI.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
