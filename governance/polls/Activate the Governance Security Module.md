# Poll: Activate the Governance Security Module - December 9, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to activate the [Governance Security Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation#1-introduction-summary).

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 9 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, December 13, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [blog post](https://blog.makerdao.com/governance-security-module-gsm/) on December 9, 2019. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
