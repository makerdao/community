# Poll: Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium - June 29, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll express support or opposition to increasing the WBTC Debt Ceiling from 10m to 20m, and increasing the WBTC Risk Premium from 1% to 2%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 29 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, July 3, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2824) on June 13th, 2020. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
