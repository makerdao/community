# Poll:Adopt the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for use on current and future vault-types - January 18, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Mandated Actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adopting the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) for use with current and future vault-types. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-rolling-out-the-debt-ceiling-instant-access-module-dc-iam/6008) to help inform your position before voting. Please see [MIP27](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip27-debt-ceiling-instant-access-module/4625/1) for further information about the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Implementations for the existing vault-types will be added over the next few months, according to the MakerDAO Risk Domain Team’s availability, with on-chain polls to confirm the new risk parameters on a per vault-type basis.
* Risk evaluations for new vault-types will also include values for the `ttl` and `gap` parameters required for the DC-IAM.
* The DC-IAM may not be used for all vault-types, at the discretion of the MakerDAO Risk Domain Team.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
