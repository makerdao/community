# Ratification Poll for Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Request (MIP47c3-SP1) - April 11, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP47c3-SP1 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Now that the Content Production Core Unit has been offboarded, their wallet should be removed from the recognized multi-sig list. Currently, no funds are available in the multi-sig, but it can still claim ~3.8k DAI from their canceled budget stream.*

*Seeing as the Content Production Core Unit is no longer an active Core Unit for the DAO, there is only downside to leaving their multi-sig Governance recognized. Given the small amount of funds that can still be claimed, there is little danger to publicly announce our intentions to close the loop with the DssVest stream. However, this process is clearly vulnerable to front running until the procedure for reclaiming funds and permissions is improved.*

*If this subproposal is accepted, there will be the technical work of claiming the budget funds and returning them to the surplus buffer, to be completed in a future executive proposal.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, April 28.
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**
