# Poll: Adjust the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling - August 31, 2020

The Maker Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling from 80 Million to 120 Million DAI.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 31 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, September 4, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The signal request for increasing the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3731) along with the results. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on Friday, September 4, 2020.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.

If the Friday executive passes, then this debt ceiling change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
