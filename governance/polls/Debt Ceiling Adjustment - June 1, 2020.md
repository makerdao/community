# Poll: Debt Ceiling Adjustment - June 1, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to alter the **Dai Debt Ceiling**. Voters are now able to signal their support to:

- Raise the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 20 million to 140 million Dai

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 1 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, June 5, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

As outlined in the "Debt Ceiling" section of the previously ratified [Migration Risk Construct](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmba2hpv3kcbjgzvlnv7xsogs3jenqdiqo3ffnktgqtepn) proposal, the Interim Risk Team is putting forth this governance proposal.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
