# Whitelist DDEX on BTCUSD Medianizer Oracle (MIP10c9-SP8)- September 21, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Oracle Domain Team. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to appending DDEX to the BTCUSD Medianizer Oracle whitelist to read price data.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

## Review

Please review the discussion [MIP10c9-SP8: Whitelist DDEX on WBTCUSD Oracle](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c9-sp8-whitelist-ddex-on-wbtcusd-oracle/4094) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.

If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
