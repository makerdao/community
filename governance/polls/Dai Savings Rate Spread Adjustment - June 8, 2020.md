Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Dai Savings Rate Spread** within a range of 0% to 4%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 8 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, June 12, at 4 PM UTC.
