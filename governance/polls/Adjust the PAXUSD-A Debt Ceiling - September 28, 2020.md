# Poll: Adjust the PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling - September 28, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition for a **PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling** increase from its current value to 100 million Dai.

The current value of the PAXUSD-A debt ceiling may change before this poll goes live. This value will depend on the outcome of the executive vote taking place on Friday, September 25, 2020.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 28 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, October 2, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-paxusd-a-debt-ceiling/4263) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If the Friday executive passes, then this debt ceiling change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
