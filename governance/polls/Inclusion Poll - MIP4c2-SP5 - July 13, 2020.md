# Inclusion Poll for MIP4c2-SP5: MIP12 Amendments - July 13, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the proposal (MIP4c2-SP5: MIP12 Amendments) should be included into the Monthly Governance Poll.

If the **Yes** votes in this inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** when the poll ends, the proposal should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll. Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.

## Review

The proposal can be reviewed here: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3137. It was also mentioned and possibly discussed on the most recent [Governance Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2KzVB460Zc) on July 9, 2020.

## Next Steps

If the Inclusion poll passes, the Governance Facilitator(s) will confirm this proposals inclusion within the next Monthly Governance Poll on the Thursday Governance and Risk call on July 16, 2020. The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP3/mip3.md).
