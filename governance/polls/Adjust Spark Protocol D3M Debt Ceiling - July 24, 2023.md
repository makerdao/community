# Poll: Adjust Spark Protocol D3M Debt Ceiling - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to using the Spark Protocol Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) with the listed parameters. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to making the following parameter changes to the Spark Protocol DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M):
* Increase the DIRECT-SPARK-DAI [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) by 180 million DAI from 20 million DAI to **200 million DAI**.

The [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) and [Ceiling Increase Cooldown](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#ceiling-increase-cooldown-ttl) parameters will remain unchanged at 20 million DAI and 8 hours respectively.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/phoenix-labs-proposed-changes-for-spark/21422) to help inform your position before voting.

For more information regarding the DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) and how these parameters interact, check out the forum thread [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-direct-deposit-dai-module-d3m/7357) and the entry in the Operational Manual [here](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
