# MIP4c2-SP2: Inclusion Poll for MIP8 Amendments - June 8, 2020

On June 8, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal, [MIP4c2-SP2 (MIP8 Amendments)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2664), will proceed to next week's Governance Poll. In short, MIP4c2-SP2 proposes that the Domain Greenlight process (MIP8) should occur after the proposed collateral asset has passed the MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll allowing the Domain teams to use the Community Greenlight Poll results to make a more informed decision and proceed with their domain work.

**Inclusion Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.
