# Poll: Create ETH-B Vault Type - October 5th, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition for an **ETH-B Vault Type**.

The proposed intitial Risk Parameters for ETH-B are:

- Stability Fee: 6%

- Liquidation Ratio: 130%

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 5th at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, October 9th, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **ETH-B Vault Type** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-add-eth-b-vault-collateral-type-september-2020/4435) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If the Friday executive passes, then this debt ceiling change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
