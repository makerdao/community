# Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent: Invest in Short-Term Bonds (MIP13c3-SP12) - March 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP13c3-SP12 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter:*

- *As of writing, around 60% of the MakerDAO balance sheet is in stablecoin. We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos*
- *It becomes clear that investing in DeFi Money Markets is not easy to scale (D3M rarely use more than 50M DAI)*
- *[Work in this direction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/investing-our-liquidity-in-short-term-etf-managing-psms-exposures/10891) was stopped and a [potential Core Unit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp16-adding-maker-portfolio-core-unit-mpcu-001/8996) potentially doing this job was never established*

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, March 31. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).
