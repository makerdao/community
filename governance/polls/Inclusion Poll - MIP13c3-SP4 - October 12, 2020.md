# Inclusion Poll for Declaration of Intent - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets (MIP13c3-SP4) - October 12, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the proposal (Declaration of Intent - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets) should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll.

If the **Yes** votes in this inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** when the poll ends, the proposal should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll. Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
