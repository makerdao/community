# Poll: Stability Fee Adjustment Proposal- November 2, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Rates Working Group which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition for the proposed Stability Fee changes.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 2 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Summary of Proposed Changes:

- **Reduce ETH-B Stability Fee from 6% to 4%.**

Discussion and rationale for these changes can be found in this week's rates proposal thread [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rates-changes-proposal-26-oct-2020/4877). Please review this thread to inform your position before voting.

Please refer to the [Rates V2 thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-rates-v2/4481) for an overview of the Rates Working Group mandate.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, these parameter changes will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.
