# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Replace Dai oracle with one that is hardcoded to 1 USD - January 8, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the replacement of the current Dai oracle on Ethereum with one that is hardcoded to 1 USD to prevent excessive borrows during temporary depeg events.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-spell-proposed-changes/23298) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to include this change on SparkLend Ethereum.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
