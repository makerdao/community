# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - August 17, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed the MIP3: Monthly Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling). This poll asks whether the bundled contents of this month's Governance Cycle should proceed to an Executive Vote to be held on August 24, 2020. The bundled contents of this poll consist of:

- [MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP13/MIP13c3-Subproposals/MIP13c3-SP1.md)
- [MIP0c13-SP1: Subproposal for Core Personnel Offboarding](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP0/MIP0c13-Subproposals/MIP0c13-SP1.md)

This Monthly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for approximately 3 days beginning on Monday, August 14 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The proposals can be reviewed in this weeks weekly MIPs update [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3618). It was also discussed on the latest [Governance and Risk call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3570) on August 13, 2020.

## Next Steps

MKR holders must vote to determine whether to accept or reject the bundle of proposals included within the Monthly Governance Poll, determining whether the bundle should proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle. The Executive Vote will be submitted on August 24, 2020 if the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on August 20, 2020.
