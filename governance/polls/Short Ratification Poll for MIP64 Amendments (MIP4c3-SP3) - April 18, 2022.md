# Short Ratification Poll to Amend MIP64 to allow more flexibility in scope (MIP4c3-SP3) - April 18, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP16](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 18 at 16:00 UTC.

As per [MIP4c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4#MIP4c3), and passage of the required [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/advance-mip4c3-sp3-amend-mip64-to-allow-more-flexibility-in-scope-to-on-chain-poll/14435), this subproposal meets the requirements to be entered into the Weekly Governance Cycle.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c3-SP3 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*During Feb 2022, we had two bug submissions for web vulns that were troublesome to categorize (post-mortems coming soon). A month later, bounties for these bugs are still being negotiated. A great deal of time was spent trying to find resolutions that seemed fair to both sides, for the whitehats and DUX. The change here would give more discretion to IS-001 to determine the bug bounty scope. This will allow us to refine the rules to reduce gray areas and potential disagreements.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, April 21. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected.**
