# Poll: Add GUSD as a Collateral Type - October 26, 2020

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding GUSD (Gemini Dollar) as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 26 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The proposed initial system parameters for GUSD are:

* Stability Fee: 4%
* Liquidation Ratio: 101%
* Debt Ceiling: 5 million
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 6 hours
* Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* Dust: 100 Dai

Please review the following forum threads containing information about GUSD (Gemini Dollar) to inform your position before voting.

* [Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/gusd-collateral-onbording-risk-evaluation/4791)
* [Smart Contracts Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/gusd-erc20-token-smart-contract-technical-assessment/4603)
* [Oracles Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c3-sp13-proposal-gusd-oracle-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment/4777)

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes, GUSD (Gemini Dollar) will be included in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

If this proposal fails to pass, GUSD (Gemini Dollar) will not be added to the Maker Protocol at this time.
