# Poll: Increase the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling - August 2, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following [Maximum Debt Ceiling (line)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam/) options for UNIV2DAIUSDC-A:
* Increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) to 250 million DAI (+200M)
* Increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) to 150 million DAI (+100M)
* Increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) to 100 million DAI (+50M)
* Keep Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) set to 50 million DAI (+0)

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-univ2daiusdc-a-dc-iam-line/9481) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, then change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
