# Poll: Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type - August 30, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding RWA007 (SolarX) as a new vault type in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

### Collateral Parameters

* [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee): 5.8%
* [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling): $21,000,000 equivalent in Dai (21,200,000 DAI with a buffer)
* Minimum Vault Collateralization Ratio: 100%
* Minimum SPV Collateralization Ratio: 133%
* Minimum Underlying Collateralization Ratio: 133%
* Liquidation Process: [MIP21](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP21) 

Please review the following forum threads containing information about RWA007 (SolarX) to inform your position before voting.
* [Initial Collateral Application](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/solarx-mip6-application-uprets-solarx-industrial-real-estate-backed-loans/6718)
* [Real-World Finance Core Unit Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/solar-x-collateral-onboarding-risk-assessment/9977)
* [Protocol Engineering Core Unit Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa007-solarx-mip21-token-protocol-engineering-domain-team-assessment/10016)
* [Oracles Core Unit Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-007-solarx-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment-mip10c3-sp40/10070)

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**
* RWA007 (SolarX) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option, then no further action will be taken at this time.**
