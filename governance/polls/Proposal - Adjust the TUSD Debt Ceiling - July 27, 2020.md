# Poll: Adjust the TUSD Debt Ceiling - July 27, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to decreasing the TUSD Debt Ceiling from 2MM to zero.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 27 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, July 31, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The initial proposal for reducing the TUSD Debt Ceiling can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3225) along with the signal request results. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on Friday, July 31, 2020.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, TUSD will be reviewed further by the Smart Contracts team and then voted on again in terms of the next steps for risk parameter adjustments.
