# PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - February 27, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following parameter changes:

### [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) Increases

* Increase the **ETH-C** Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.5% to **0.75%**.
* Increase the **WSTETH-B** Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.5% to **0.75%**.
* Increase the **WBTC-C** Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.75% to **1%**.
* Increase the **YFI-A** Stability Fee by 0.5% from 1% to **1.5%**.

### [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) Increases

* Increase the **RETH-A** Maximum Debt Ceiling by 10 million DAI from 10 million DAI to **20 million DAI**.
* Increase the **YFI-A** Maximum Debt Ceiling by 1 million DAI from 3 million DAI to **4 million DAI**.
* Increase the **Compound v2 D3M** Maximum Debt Ceiling by 40 million DAI from 30 million DAI to **70 million DAI**.
* Increase the **Aave v2 D3M** Maximum Debt Ceiling by 15 million DAI from 5 million DAI to **20 million DAI.** 

The Protocol Engineering Core Unit may delay the Maximum Debt Ceiling increase for the Aave v2 D3M at their discretion given the contract was only deployed recently.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-22-february-2023/19936) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
