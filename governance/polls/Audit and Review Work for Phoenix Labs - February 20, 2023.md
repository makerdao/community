# Poll: Audit and Review Work for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the [Protocol Engineering Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP7). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 20 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the [Protocol Engineering Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP7) diverting resources from other tasks to accomplish the review of Spark Protocol (by Phoenix Labs). The following items would be in the immediate scope:

- Review the Aave v3 fork and any differences (as part of a D3M integration)
- Review the new interest rate mechanics as part of Spark Lend
- Present a technical assessment of the integration partner (Spark Lend)
- Consider a resubmission to ChainSecurity pending any code changes
- Liaison with Phoenix Labs to create a Governance Executive when ready to launch

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/pecu-seeking-governance-clarification-of-intent-re-phoenix-labs/19840) to help inform your position before voting.

* The [Protocol Engineering Core Unit](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP7) will allocate the necessary auditing and review resources for Spark Protocol.
