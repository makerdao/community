# MIP10c15-SP6 Governance Poll to Appoint MyCrypto as Oracle Light Feed - August 10, 2020

On August 10, 2020 the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal MIP10c15-SP6 will proceed to a final Executive Vote. In short, MIP10c15-SP6 appoints MyCrypto as an Oracle Light Feed who submits price data to the MakerDAO Oracles.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

## Review

The proposal to appoint MyCrypto as an Oracle Light Feed can be reviewed here: [MIP10c15-SP6: Subproposal to Appoint MyCrypto as Oracle Light Feed](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3383/2).

## Next Steps

If the Governance Poll passes, the Oracle Team will assist MyCrypto to setup and configure their Oracle Light Feed. Then the proposal will proceed to a final ratification vote (Executive Vote).
