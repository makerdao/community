# Poll: Vault Compensation Working Group Payment - January 11, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to transferring 12,700 Dai from the surplus buffer to members of the vault compensation working group for their past work organizing the vault compensation proposals. Funds will be allocated to individual members as follows:

@makerman: 6,300 Dai to [address]

@monet-supply: 3,800 Dai to [0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265]

@Joshua_Pritikin: 2,000 Dai to [address]

@befitsandpiper: 400 Dai to [address]

@Vault2288: 200 Dai to [address]

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 11 at 16:00 UTC. If approved by voters, the payments would then be included in the Executive vote held on Friday, January 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-vault-compensation-working-group-payment/5562) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
