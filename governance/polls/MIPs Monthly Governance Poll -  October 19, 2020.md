## Review

The proposals can be reviewed in this week's weekly MIPs update [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/weekly-mips-update-17/4746). It was also discussed on the latest [Governance and Risk call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-114-thursday-october-15-16-00-utc/4657) on October 15, 2020.

## Next Steps

MKR holders must vote to determine whether to accept or reject the bundle of proposals included within the Monthly Governance Poll, determining whether the bundle should proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle. 

The Executive Vote will be submitted on October 26, 2020 if the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on October 22, 2020.
