# Poll: Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling - July 27, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the WBTC Debt Ceiling from 20MM to 34MM.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 27 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, July 31, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3223) on July 15, 2020. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on Friday, July 31, 2020.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.
