# MIP4c2-SP4: Inclusion Poll for MIP12 Amendments - June 8, 2020

On June 8, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal, [MIP4c2-SP4 (MIP12 Amendments)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2666), will proceed to next week's Governance Poll. In short, MIP4c2-SP4 proposes an update to MIP12 to allow the collateral onboarding process to operate more efficiently. More specifically, it states that collateral onboarding can continue to operate despite not having an official General Risk Model ratified through the [MIP11](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP11/mip11.md) process.

**Inclusion Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.
