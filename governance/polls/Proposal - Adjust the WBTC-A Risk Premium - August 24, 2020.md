# Poll: WBTC Risk Premium Adjustment - August 24, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the WBTC-A Risk Premium from 2% to 4%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 24 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, August 28, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The WBTC Risk Premium was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-change-the-rps-for-various-collateral-types/3484) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on Friday, August 28, 2020.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
