# Poll: Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 1 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:

* A tactical re-allocation of budgets following a framework developed by the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) in conjunction with Core Units, MKR holders, Recognized Delegates and the Maker Community.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-budget-re-allocation-core-unit-accountability-framework/16788) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* The Strategic Finance Core Unit will co-ordinate the budget re-allocation process with Core Unit, MKR holders and Recognized Delegates.
* Any proposed changes to current Core Unit Budgets will be required to go through the approved governance processes.
* Any changes that are approved by MKR holders will be implemented via an Executive Vote, as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
