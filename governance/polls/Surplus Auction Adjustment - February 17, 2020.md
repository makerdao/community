# Poll: Surplus Auction Adjustment - February 17, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to **alter the minimum bid increase for Surplus Auctions**.

Voters are now able to signal their support to:

- Lower the minimum bid increase by 1% to 2%

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 17, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, February 21, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

Currently, Surplus Auctions (FLAPs) require Keepers to bid in increments of greater than 3% for each new bid. If this proposal passes, the minimum bid necessary would be reduced to 2%.

More info on auctions can be found [here](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/keepers/auctions/auctions-101.md).

Discussion on this topic can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1219).

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
