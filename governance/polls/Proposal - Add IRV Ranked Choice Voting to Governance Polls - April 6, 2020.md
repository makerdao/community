# Poll: Add IRV Ranked Choice Voting to Governance Polls - April 6, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to signal their support for adding instant run-off (IRV) ranked choice voting support to future governance polls.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 6 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

This proposal was discussed in the [forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1274). Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

* If this proposal passes, the governance portal development team will begin work on adding support for instant run-off ranked choice voting to the governance portal. Once development is completed, any future poll author will have the option to run the poll as ranked choice.
