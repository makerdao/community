# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Activate Kill Switch Security Module - March 25, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 25 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the activation of the Kill Switch Security Module on SparkLend Ethereum. The Kill Switch Security Module allows SparkLend Protocol to disable all borrowing across markets in the event of a depeg on key collateral assets.

Initial oracles to onboard at 0.95 threshold:

WBTC/BTC
STETH/ETH

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mar-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/23918) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marsfoundation/sparklend-kill-switch) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to include this change on SparkLend Ethereum.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
