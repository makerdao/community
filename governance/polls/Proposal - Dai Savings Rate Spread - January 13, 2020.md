# Poll: Should we replace the weekly DSR Rate governance poll with a weekly DSR Spread governance poll?

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which represents a community led initiative to replace Dai Savings Rate polls with a pre-defined spread.

This proposal states:

"If passed, the weekly Dai Savings Rate Adjustment governance poll will be replaced with a weekly Dai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment governance poll. The Dai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment poll will use the same exponential rate stepping options as the other governance polls with a lower bound of 0%.

The Dai Savings Rate Spread will determine the Dai Savings Rate by using the following formula:

**Dai Savings Rate = max(Dai Stability Fee - Dai Savings Rate Spread, 0)**

(the max() prevents the case where the Dai Savings Rate is negative)"
