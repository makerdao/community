# Whitelist Oasis.app on Multiple Oracles (MIP10c9-SP30) - April 18, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Oracles Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to appending Oasis.app to the following Oracle Security Module whitelists to read current and queued price data:
* ETHUSD
* WSTETHUSD
* WBTCUSD
* RENBTCUSD
* YFIUSD
* UNIUSD
* LINKUSD
* MANAUSD

Please review the application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c9-sp30-proposal-to-whitelist-oasis-app-on-ethusd-wstethusd-wbtcusd-renbtcusd-yfiusd-uniusd-linkusd-manausd/14379) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote. It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
