# Poll: Unblock the remaining Debt Auctions - March 23, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to unblock the remaining Debt Auctions from the system.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 23 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, March 27, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The method for unblocking the remaining Debt Auctions was discussed in the Governance call on Friday, March 20. Please review the [Video](https://youtu.be/OIWJ8tdGnbk?t=1100), [Summary](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-friday-life-comes-at-you-fast-edition-march-20-9am-pst-4-00-pm-utc/1725/3s) and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.
