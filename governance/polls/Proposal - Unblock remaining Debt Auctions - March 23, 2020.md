# Poll: Unblock the remaining Debt Auctions - March 23, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to unblock the remaining Debt Auctions from the system.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 23 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, March 27, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The method for unblocking the remaining Debt Auctions was discussed in the Governance call on Friday, March 20.
