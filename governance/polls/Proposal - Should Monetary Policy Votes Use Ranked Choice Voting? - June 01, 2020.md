# Poll: Should Monetary Policy Votes Use Ranked Choice Voting? - June 01, 2020

## Description

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed this poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the community.

If passed, this poll is to be taken as a signal to domain teams that MKR Token Holders have approved Ranked Choice Voting on all future monetary policy polls such as Base Rate, DSR spread, and Collateral Risk Premiums.

## Review

Please review the [forum signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2589), the [original forum discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/912), and [a brief description of ranked choice voting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9GDaRhGZC8&t=10m14s) provided on the May 28, 2020 governance call to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes, future monetary policy votes will use the Ranked Choice voting mechanism starting the week of Jun 8, 2020.
