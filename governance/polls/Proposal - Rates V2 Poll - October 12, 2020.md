# Poll: Rates V2 Poll - October 12, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition for the implementation of the Rates V2 plan.

This non-standard weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, October 12 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please refer to the [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-rates-v2/4481) for a detailed outline of the proposal.

Plan:

- Scrap the current Stability Fee formula involving the Base Rate. The Base Rate will no longer be voted on after this proposal passes, and a MIP18 vote will be added to deprecate it formally.
- Formation of the Rates Working Group. A somewhat loosely defined group consisting of Domain Team Facilitators and community members. Initial members being @hexonaut, @Primoz, @LongForWisdom, @monet-supply, @SebVentures and @Akiva.
- Introduction of the Competitive Rate: A rate which is based on the competitive landscape. For example if our competition is offering borrowing at 5% for a particular asset, we may decide to offer that same asset for 4%.
- The Rates Working Group will keep track of governance directives, risk premiums and competitive rates to produce a set of stability fees for each vault type. Mostly this will involve setting the rates by competitive analysis coming from risk.
- The Risk Team will start producing Risk Premium / Competitive Rates on a monthly basis which get handed off to the Rates Working Group who will propose the Stability Fee rate changes.
- Dai Savings Rate will remain at 0% until governance signals otherwise.
- Development of a more formal MIP as this process is smoothed out.

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes then:

- The plan described above will be implemented.
- There will be no base rate votes starting the week of October 19th.
- The Risk team will produce numbers starting week of October 19th.
- The Rates group will make their first proposal in the forums starting the week of October 19th.
- The Rates group will create a governance poll for October 26th which, pending success, will go into the Friday executive.

If this proposal fails to pass then:

- The status quo will remain.
- The Rates group will work to produce an alternative proposal based on feedback.
