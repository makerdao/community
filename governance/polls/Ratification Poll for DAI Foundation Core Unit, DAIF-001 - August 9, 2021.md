### Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation (MIP39c2-SP17)

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This proposal is for the DAIF Core Unit to be the vehicle that enables the practical implementation of the critical services that Dai Foundation provides to MakerDAO. The Core unit will request the necessary budget from MakerDAO Governance to sustain its operations and adequately mitigate the related legal risks to its essential role. The services of Dai Foundation are to provide safe haven and protect Maker IP including the DAI and MAKER trademarks (for example, what if somebody launches a DAI token on another chain?), set terms for use of Maker Assets that enables Maker Governance to appoint managers of those assets and to react to edge cases like for example a malicious fork according to principles that will be developed in close collaboration with the Maker community.*
