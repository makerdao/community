# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - STAKE (xDAI STAKE) - January 18, 2021

## Description

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP9: Community Greenlight](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP9/mip9.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the asset STAKE (xDAI STAKE) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list). 

Please review the collateral onboarding application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stake-mip6-collateral-onboarding-application/5551) to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* The 'greenlight score' will be calculated for STAKE (xDAI STAKE) using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The 'greenlight score' for STAKE (xDAI STAKE) will be added to the [Collateral Prioritisation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitator(s).
* The Domain Teams will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new collateral types.
