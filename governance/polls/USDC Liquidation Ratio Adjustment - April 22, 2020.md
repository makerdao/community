# Poll: USDC Liquidation Ratio Adjustment - April 22, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Liquidation Ratio** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **USDC Liquidation Ratio** within a range of 105% to 125%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Wednesday, April 22 at 9 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, April 24, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The **USDC Liquidation Ratio** was discussed in the [[USDC plus additional Stablecoins] Risk Parameter Request for Comment](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2119) thread. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
