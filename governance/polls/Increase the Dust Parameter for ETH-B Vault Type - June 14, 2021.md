# Poll: Increase the Dust Parameter for ETH-B Vault Type - June 14, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on June 14, 2020 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to modifying the [Debt Floor](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-floor) (also known as Dust) parameter for the ETH-B vault type:
* Increase the Dust Parameter from 15,000 DAI to 30,000 DAI for the ETH-B vault type.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjusting-dust-parameter-2021-3/8315) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option recieves more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, then change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, then no further actions will be taken at this time.**
