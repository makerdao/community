# Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP67 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP67 intends to (1) formally approve the Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions 17 published by the Real-World Finance Core Unit, and (2) introduce a high-level process that each MIP6-compliant application should undergo in order to receive, eventually, a positive endorsement from the relevant real-world CU stakeholder groups. E.g. RWF-001, SES-incubated Lending Oversight team, future CUs.*
