# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum and Gnosis - Turn off Siloed Borrowing for USDC, USDT, and EURe - May 27, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to SparkLend:

- Turn off [siloed borrowing](https://docs.sparkprotocol.io/developers/sparklend/features/siloed-borrowing) for Circle USD (USDC) and Tether USD (USDT) on both Ethereum and Gnosis.
- Turn off siloed borrowing for Monerium EURO e-money (EURe) on Gnosis.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327) and [analysis by BA Labs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327/2) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to turn off siloed borrowing for USDC and Tether USDT on both Ethereum and Gnosis, and for EURe on Gnosis.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
