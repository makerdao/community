# Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP68 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Protocol Engineering would like to secure an operating budget for it to deliver its mandate over the next 12 months.*

*The [prior yearâ€™s budget in review](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/pecu-2021-2022-financial-year-in-review/13793) gave a good illustration as to where Protocol Engineering under- or over- budgeted for the work we sought to accomplish, which has subsequently helped inform this document.*

*The following proposal is also in support of the forum post: [Protocol Engineering Core Unit Workstreams](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/protocol-engineering-core-unit-workstreams/13795). Our team stands behind this proposal as an optimal solution for scaling the Core Unit in a dynamic environment. We encourage readers to review that post in conjunction with the below budget request.*
