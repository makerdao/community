# Ratification Poll for Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 - July 12, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, July 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the Growth Core Unit Budget being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This budget proposal covers a total of 3 months (August, September, and October of 2021). During these three months, our focus will be on:*

* *We have 93 opportunities at the last stages of the Growth Process cycle. We will drive these opportunities to the next step by launching adoption campaigns with our partners.*
* *Institutional vaults: we will find the proper implementation with the Maker community and larger vault users.*
* *Dai in other Networks: Increase Dai usage in other networks like Polygon and Solana.*

*Growth CU is asking for a total of 937,950 DAI over three months. 437,950 DAI will cover operations, and 500,000 DAI will cover the work weâ€™ll do with our partners in the latest stages of the Growth Cycle (adoption campaigns, educational content, etc.).*
