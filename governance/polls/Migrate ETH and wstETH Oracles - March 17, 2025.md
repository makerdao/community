## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Sky Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.9.2.1_Pause_Delay/a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0%7C0db30758e055) has expired.
