# Poll: Approve Maker Representatives - October 19, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition for the initial list of individuals serving as Maker Representatives based on the contents of MIP21 and MIP13c3-SP4.

This non-standard weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, October 19 at 16:00 UTC.
