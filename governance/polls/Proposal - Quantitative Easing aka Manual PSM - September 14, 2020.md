# Poll: Quantitative Easing aka Manual PSM - September 14, 2020

The Maker Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to a community implementation of Quantitative Easing (aka Manual PSM).

This non-standard weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 14 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The signal request for Quantitative Easing can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3902) along with the results. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, the community will have MKR Token Holders support for providing an implementation.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, implementation of Quantitative Easing will not be pursued.
