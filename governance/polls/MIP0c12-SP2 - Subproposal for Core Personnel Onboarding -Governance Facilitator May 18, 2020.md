# Governance Poll for Core Personnel Onboarding (Governance Facilitator) - May 18, 2020

Today, on May 18, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the subproposal to add [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/longforwisdom/summary) as a Governance Facilitator should proceed to the final Executive Vote next week.

## Review

The proposal to add [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/longforwisdom/summary) as a Governance Facilitator can be reviewed here: [MIP0c12-SP2: Subproposal for Core Personnel Onboarding (Governance Facilitator)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2351).

## Next Steps

MKR holders must vote to determine whether to accept or reject the proposal at hand in the Governance Poll, determining whether to proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle. The Executive Vote is submitted if the Governance Facilitator confirms the 'yes' outcome of the Governance Poll.
