# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - yUSD (yyCRV) - October 19, 2020

## Description

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the asset yUSD (yyCRV) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list). 

If greenlight votes exceed defer votes, this poll is to be taken as a signal to domain teams that MKR Token Holders have approved further domain work with the aim of adding yUSD (yyCRV) as a collateral asset to the Maker Protocol.

## Review

Please review the collateral onboarding application [forum thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/yusd-mip6-collateral-onboarding-application/4269/1) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

The domain teams will use the outcome of this poll to inform the direction of their collateral onboarding work.
