# Poll: MKR Oracle Deactivation in SCD - April 20th, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team and the Interim Oracle Team have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system for the community to signal their support for the Oracle team to deactivate the MKR Oracle in Single Collateral Dai.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 20.

## Review

This proposal was discussed in the [forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sequential-process-for-scd-shutdown/1823). Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes, the MKR Oracle will be deactivated by the Oracle Team once the SCD shutdown spell is voted on or after April 24th. The action of deactivating the Oracle will eliminate stability fees and incentivise users to migrate their CDPs during the grace period. This process helps the community of remaining CDP holders work together to drain the migration contract, and reduces the burden and exposure of liquidity providers needing to source large amounts of Sai for the migration contract in order to avoid unbacked debt in MCD. For a review of the discussion, awareness of risks and implications please visit the [forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sequential-process-for-scd-shutdown/1823).
