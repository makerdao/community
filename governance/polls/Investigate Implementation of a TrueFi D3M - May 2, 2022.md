# Poll: Investigate Implementation of a TrueFi D3M - May 2, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning Monday, May 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether a TrueFi [D3M](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state) and [Domain Teams](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP7#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-onboard-d3m-for-truefi/14563) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* A TrueFi D3M will be added to the [Collateral Status Index (CSI)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PDf_CzhGa7mLuOUfX6Bz3WrnCjDRhIjmu-vDZMMw4Qc/edit#gid=1077340672) by the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit.
* This TrueFi D3M will be added with a 'greenlight score' calculated using the outcome of this poll using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The Core Units and Domain Teams will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new vault-types.
