# Poll: Should we reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll to once per month?

If passed, the frequency of the "Dai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment" governance poll will be reduced to one poll per month. The poll will only be added on the first Monday of every month. The relative start and end times for the poll will remain unchanged.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 24 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, February 28, at 5 PM UTC.
