# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - BPT-50WBTC-50WETH (50% WBTC 50% ETH Balancer Pool Token) - January 18, 2021

## Description

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP9: Community Greenlight](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP9/mip9.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the asset BPT-50WBTC-50WETH (50% WBTC 50% ETH Balancer Pool Token) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list). 

Note, there are currently multiple Balancer Pools matching the 50% WBTC 50% WETH profile. In the case that this collateral type is prioritised, the domain teams will make a decision on which balancer pool contract to support. 

Please review the collateral onboarding application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/bpt-50wbtc-50weth-balancer-wbtc-eth-50-50-liquidity-token-collateral-application/5662) to inform your position before voting.
