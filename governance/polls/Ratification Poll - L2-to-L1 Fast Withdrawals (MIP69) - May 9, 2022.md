# Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) - May 9, 2022.

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, May 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP69 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*Teleporting DAI from L2 to L1 is known as a “Fast Withdrawal”. To complete a fast withdrawal, DAI is burnt on L2, minted on L1, and sent to the user as soon as the L2 transaction is confirmed.

This MIP focuses on the above L2-to-L1 transaction. L2-to-L2 transactions will be defined in a future MIP when the full Wormhole functionality is ready to be launched.*
