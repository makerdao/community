# Poll: Dai Savings Rate Adjustment - February 15, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 15 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the [Dai Savings Rate](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/Dai/dsr) should be raised from 0% to 0.01%.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-raise-dsr/6241) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 
* If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
