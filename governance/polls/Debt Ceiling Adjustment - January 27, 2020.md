# Poll: Debt Ceiling Adjustment - January 27, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to alter the **Sai Debt Ceilings**. Voters are now able to signal their support to:

- Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 15 million to 30 million Sai

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 27, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, January 31, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

>"Until we can fully understand the ramifications of the unpaid stability fees, the ~20 million of unused cap space is likely too much and opens up the community to unnecessary risk.".

Please review the [discussion thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/lowering-the-sai-debt-ceiling/1190) for more information.

As outlined in the "Debt Ceiling" section of the previously ratified [Migration Risk Construct](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmba2hpv3kcbjgzvlnv7xsogs3jenqdiqo3ffnktgqtepn) proposal, the Interim Risk Team is putting forth a governance proposal to reduce the SCD Sai Debt Ceiling to 30 million.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
