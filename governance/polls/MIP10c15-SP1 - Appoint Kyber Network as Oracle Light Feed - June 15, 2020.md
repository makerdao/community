# MIP10c15-SP1 Governance Poll to Appoint Kyber Network as Oracle Light Feed - June 15, 2020

On June 15, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal MIP10c15-SP1 will proceed to the final Executive Vote on June 26th. In short, MIP10c15-SP1 appoints Kyber Network as an Oracle Light Feed who submits price data to the MakerDAO Oracles.

**Governance Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the Governance Poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in a following Executive Vote. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Executive Vote.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

## Next Steps

If the Governance Poll passes, the Oracle Team will assist Kyber Network to setup and configure their Oracle Light Feed. Then the proposal will proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) on June 26th.
