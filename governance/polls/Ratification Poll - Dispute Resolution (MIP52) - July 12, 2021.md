# Ratification Poll for Dispute Resolution (MIP52) - July 12, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, July 12 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP52 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This MIP outlines a process by which any community member or stakeholder can elevate the resolution of a dispute directly to MKR holders. There will be two primary components to this MIP, one which allows for the dispute to be settled in the normal governance cycle and another that permits for an immediate resolution, and a third component which sets a parameter for the immediate resolution component.*
