## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP21: Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The Content Production Core Unit’s initial budget provides three months of runway (May, June, July) to establish operations in accordance with our mandate.*

*This proposal is for a total of 201,200 Dai to fund the team for August, September, and October.*

*Unless the team significantly expands the scope of its activities, this quarter’s budget should be ~50,000 DAI higher than a typical quarter due to the inclusion of a Continuity Fund to pay contributors in the event a budget is delayed or some other emergency occurs.*
