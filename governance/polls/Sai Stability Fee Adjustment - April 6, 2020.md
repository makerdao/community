# Poll: Sai Stability Fee Adjustment - April 6, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Sai Stability Fee** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Sai Stability Fee** within a range of 3.5% to 11.5%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 6 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, April 10, at 4 PM UTC.
