# Poll: Should we suspend monetary policy votes when there are emergency technical changes to be made to the system?

If passed, when emergency technical changes to the Dai Credit System are required they will supersede non-emergency monetary policy changes when the next executive bundle is created.

The decision over whether or not a technical change is an Emergency is determined by the Technical / Development team employed by the Maker Foundation. In the future, this authority may be voted to an alternative entity.

The decision over whether or not a monetary policy change is an Emergency is determined by the Interim Risk Team employed by the Maker Foundation. In the future, this authority may be voted to an alternative entity.

When non-emergency monetary policy changes are superseded in an emergency:

- They are not added to the next executive vote spell.
- They may or may not be added to a subsequent executive vote spell at the discretion of the Governance Facilitator once the current governance period (currently one week) has passed.
