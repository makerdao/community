# MIP4c2-SP1: Inclusion Poll for MIP6 Amendments - June 8, 2020

On June 8, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal, [MIP4c2-SP1 (MIP6 Amendment)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2663), will proceed to next week's Governance Poll. In short, MIP4c2-SP1 proposes updates to the collateral onboarding process to allow MIP6 collateral applications to be eligible for MIP9 Community Greenlight polls at least two weeks after the MIP6 application has been proposed, as well as moving the Domain Greenlight process until after the MIP9 polls have concluded.

**Inclusion Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.
