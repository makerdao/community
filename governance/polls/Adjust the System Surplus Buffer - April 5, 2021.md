# Poll: Increase the System Surplus Buffer - April 5, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 5 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote. In an instant-runoff vote, you may rank any number of options in the order of preference. As a general rule, you should rank every option you would be willing to vote for if it was included in an executive vote. By failing to rank an option you signal that you are not willing to vote for it in an executive vote. Alternatively, if you would accept any of the listed options and have no preference as to which, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first choice and rank no other choices.**

# Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to keep or adjust the [System Surplus Buffer](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-system-surplus-buffer) (also referred to as the 'System Surplus'):
* 30 million DAI (no change)
* 60 million DAI (+30M) - 0% MKR Burn
* 60 million DAI (+30M) - 25% MKR Burn

For option 3, we will target 25% of the stability fee revenues to be used in Surplus Auctions to burn MKR. This will be achieved by increasing the System Surplus Buffer over time using a linear interpolation smart contract, instead of directly setting it to the target value of 60 million DAI. 

Because the option for 25% burn requires predicting the increase of fees over the next few months, the 25% goal is a target rather than a guarantee. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-the-surplus-buffer-march-april-2021/6979) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

# Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the support for that option exceeds 50% of the total votes cast (excluding 'Abstain' votes), then the following actions will be taken:**
* If the result requires a change to the current setting, the change will be included in a weekly Executive Vote on a Friday within the next 30 days.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**Otherwise, no further actions will be taken at this time.**
