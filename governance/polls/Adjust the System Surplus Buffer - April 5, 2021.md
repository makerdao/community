# Poll: Increase the System Surplus Buffer - April 5, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 5 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote. In an instant-runoff vote, you may rank any number of options in the order of preference. As a general rule, you should rank every option you would be willing to vote for if it was included in an executive vote. By failing to rank an option you signal that you are not willing to vote for it in an executive vote. Alternatively, if you would accept any of the listed options and have no preference as to which, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first choice and rank no other choices.**

# Review

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to keep or adjust the [System Surplus Buffer](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-system-surplus-buffer) (also referred to as the 'System Surplus'):
* 30 million DAI (no change)
* 60 million DAI (+30 MM)
* 60 million DAI (+30 MM) while trying to `flap` 25% of the collected fees 

For the `flap` option we will try to target 25% of the stability fee revenues to be used for `flap` auctions by slowly increasing the `hump` instead of directly setting it to the target value of 60 MM. 

This will add additionally complexity to the the executive spell, resulting in extra effort for the Smart Contracts team building it.

**Governance cannot give any guarantee we will eventually burn 25% as there are a lot of factors which will influence of the actual System Surplus.**

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-the-surplus-buffer-march-april-2021/6979) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

# Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option recieves more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the support for that option exceeds 50% of the total votes cast (excluding 'Abstain' votes) then the following actions will be taken:**
* If the result requires a change to the current setting, the change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**Otherwise, no further actions will be taken at this time.**
