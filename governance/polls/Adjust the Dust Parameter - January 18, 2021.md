# Poll: Increase the Dust Parameter - January 18, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 18 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to modifying the [Debt Floor](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-floor) (also known as Dust) parameter for all vault-types: 
* Increase the Dust Parameter from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI for all vault-types.
* PSM vault-types will be excluded from this change.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-dust-parameter/5963) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
