# MIP10c9-SP5 Governance Poll to Whitelist dYdX on ETH/USD Oracle - July 27, 2020

On July 27, 2020, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal MIP10c9-SP5 will be included in the Executive Vote on July 31, 2020. In short, MIP10c9-SP5 appends dYdX to the ETH/USD Medianizer whitelist to read price data.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

## Review

The proposal to whitelist dYdX on the ETHUSD Oracle can be reviewed here: [MIP10c9-SP5: Subproposal to Whitelist dYdX on ETHUSD Oracle](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3290).

## Next Steps

If the Governance Poll passes, the proposal will proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) on July 31, 2020.
