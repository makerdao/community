# Poll: Debt Ceiling Adjustment - February 17, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to alter the **Dai Debt Ceiling**. Voters are now able to signal their support to:

- Raise the Dai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 150 million Dai

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 17, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, February 21, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

As outlined in the "Debt Ceiling" section of the previously ratified [Migration Risk Construct](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmba2hpv3kcbjgzvlnv7xsogs3jenqdiqo3ffnktgqtepn) proposal, the Interim Risk Team is putting forth a governance proposal to raise the MCD Dai Debt Ceiling to 150 million.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
