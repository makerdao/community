# MIP14: Inclusion Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer - June 8, 2020

On June 8, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Proposal, [MIP14 (Protocol DAI Transfer)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2462), will proceed to next week's Governance Poll. In short, MIP14 defines a generic process for transfering DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address.

**Inclusion Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.
