# Poll: Stability Scope Bootstrapping Edits - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system using their powers defined in [MIP113c2.12.1.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-2). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
