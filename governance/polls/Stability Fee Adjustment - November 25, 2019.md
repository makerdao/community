# Poll: Sai Stability Fee Adjustment - November 25, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Sai Stability Fee** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Sai Stability Fee** within a range of 1% to 9%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 25 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, November 29, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

The **Sai Stability Fee** was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, November 21. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
- **This weekly cycle of Polling and Voting will continue until the community believes that stability has returned to the peg.**
