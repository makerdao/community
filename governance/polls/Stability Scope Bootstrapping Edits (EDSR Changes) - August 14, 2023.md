# Poll: Stability Scope Bootstrapping Edits (EDSR Changes) - August 14, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system using their powers defined in [MIP113c2.12.1.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-2). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the changes to the EDSR in the following Github Pull Request:

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.
