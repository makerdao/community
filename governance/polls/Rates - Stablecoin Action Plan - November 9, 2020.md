# Poll: Stablecoin Action Plan - November 9, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support for various Stablecoin Action Plan options.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 9 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Due to the [first Stablecoin Action Plan vote](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQed3Ca?network=mainnet#poll-detail) failing, we are going wide with the options to figure out what path governance wants to take. This is a broad poll to figure out direction before working out the details.

The options are:

 * Do Nothing - MKR will be burned and Dai will no longer be overcollateralized w.r.t. stablecoins.
 * Option 1a - Keep Raising the Surplus Buffer, Stability Fees stay at 4%
 * Option 2a - Keep Raising the Surplus Buffer, Lower Stability Fees a bit
 * Option 2 - Lower the Stablecoin Stability Fees towards 0%
 * Option 3 - Migrate Users to a new Vault Type
 * Something else - I want to do something not listed here

Please refer to the Stablecoin Action Plan [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-stablecoin-action-plan/4808) for an overview of proposed options.

## Next Steps

A followup poll will be made for the week of November 16, 2020 to determine the scheduling and details of whichever option is selected.
