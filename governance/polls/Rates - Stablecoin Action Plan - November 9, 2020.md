# Poll: Stablecoin Action Plan - November 9, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support for various Stablecoin Action Plan options.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 9 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Due to the first Stablecoin Action Plan [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQed3Ca?network=mainnet#poll-detail) failing, we are going wide with the options to figure out what path governance wants to take. This is a broad poll to figure out direction before working out the details.

The options are:

- **Do Nothing** - Stability Fees remain at 4% for stablecoin vault types, the surplus buffer is not increased as a result of this issue.
- **Option 1a** - Stability Fees remain at 4% for stablecoin vault types, the surplus buffer is increased to prevent the burning of MKR until the issue is resolved.
- **Option 1b** - Stability Fees are lowered (but remain above 0%) for stablecoin vault types, the surplus buffer is increased to prevent the burning of MKR until the issue is resolved.
- **Option 2** - Stability Fees are lowered for stablecoin vault types (with the goal of setting them to 0% as vaults approach 100% collateralization ratio)
- **Option 3** - Stability Fees and Debt Ceiling are lowered to zero for existing stablecoin vault types, new stablecoin vault types are created with 4% Stability Fees.
- **Something else** - I want to do something not listed here

Please refer to the Stablecoin Action Plan [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-stablecoin-action-plan/4808) for a more detailed explanation and discussion of proposed options.

## Next Steps

An option must have over 50% of the vote in order to be considered successful. In the event of no option having a majority, further discussion will take place about how to best move forwards.

If an option has over 50% of the vote, a follow-up poll will be made for the week of November 16, 2020 to determine the schedule and details of implementation.
