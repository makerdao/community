# Poll: Take a more Flexible and Transparent Approach to Collateral Onboarding - October 5, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the rest of the MakerDAO mandated actors. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to taking a more flexible and transparent approach to collateral onboarding along the lines presented in this [signal thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-take-a-more-flexible-and-transparent-approach-to-onboarding-collateral/4380).

The changes to the collateral onboarding process can be summarized as such:

- Suspend the usage of MIPs 8, 11 and 12 effective immediately. Suspend the parts of MIP 10 directly related to collateral onboarding.
- Explicitly allow collateral onboarding to be a flexible process that can adjust to the demands of reality.
- Publish and maintain a single public document (initially a spreadsheet) with all greenlit (and possibly other) collateral types listed and prioritised according to the varying risks and benefits of each.
- Provide Foundation-funded grants for collateral onboarding to allow the community to take more of a role in this process.

This non-standard weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 5 at 16:00 UTC.
