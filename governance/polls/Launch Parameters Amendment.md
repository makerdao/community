# Poll: Launch Parameters Amendment

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which is intended to amend the system parameters originally outlined in the [Migration Risk Construct Proposal](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmba2hpv3kcbjgzvlnv7xsogs3jenqdiqo3ffnktgqtepn).

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 11 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, November 15, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

If this proposal passes, the following system parameters will be packaged with the MCD launch executive vote:

- Initial Dai Stability Fee: **4%**
- Debt Auction Maximum Initial Bid: **250 MKR**
- Debt Auction Bid Duration: **10 minutes**

This change was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, November 7. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject these changes.
