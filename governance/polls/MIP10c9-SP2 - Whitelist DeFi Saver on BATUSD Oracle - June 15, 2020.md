# MIP10c9-SP2 Governance Poll to Whitelist DeFi Saver on BAT/USD Oracle - June 15, 2020

On June 15, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the Maker Improvement Subproposal MIP10c9-SP2 will proceed to the final Executive Vote on June 26th. In short, MIP10c9-SP2* appends DeFi Saver to the BAT/USD Oracle Security Module whitelist to read price data.

**Governance Poll Details:**

- If the **Yes** votes in the Governance Poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in a following Executive Vote. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Executive Vote.
- Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.

Note: This subproposal has been submitted under the informal weekly cycle rather than the MIP3 Governance Cycle due to inconsistencies between MIP10 and MIP3 and to avoid delaying progress in the oracles domain until MIP10 can be amended.

## Next Steps
