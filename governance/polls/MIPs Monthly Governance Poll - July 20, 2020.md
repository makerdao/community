# MIP3: Monthly Governance Poll - July 20, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed the MIP3: Monthly Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling). This poll asks whether the bundled contents of this month's Governance Cycle should proceed to an Executive Vote to be held on July 27, 2020. The bundled contents of this poll consist of:

- [MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3008)
- [MIP18: Meta-Parameter Adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3118)
- [MIP19: Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3098)
- [MIP18c4-SP1: Subproposal for Modifying Meta-Parameter Adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3119)
- [MIP12c2-SP3: Domain Work Requirements for the Onboarding of MANA](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3139)

This Monthly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, July 20 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The proposals can be reviewed in this week's weekly MIPs update [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3189). It was also discussed on the latest [Governance and Risk call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3145) on July 16, 2020.

## Next Steps

MKR holders must vote to determine whether to accept or reject the bundle of proposals included within the Monthly Governance Poll, determining whether the bundle should proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle. The Executive Vote will be submitted on July 27, 2020 if the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on July 23, 2020.
