# Poll: Stablecoin Action Plan - November 2, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition for the implementation of the Stablecoin Action Plan.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 2 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please refer to the [Stablecoin Action Plan thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-stablecoin-action-plan/4808) for an overview of the proposed plan.

`Option 3 - Migrate Users to a new Vault Type` won the signal request. If this poll passes, the Rates Working Group will work with the Smart Contracts Team to add an executive spell which will set both the Stability Fee and Debt Ceilings to 0 on the following vault types:

 * USDC-A
 * TUSD-A
 * PAXUSD-A

 This executive will then add the following vault types with the same settings, original Stability Fees and appropriate Debt Ceilings:

 * USDC-C
 * TUSD-B
 * PAXUSD-B

The target for this executive spell is Friday, December 18th, 2020. The Rates Working Group will run a governance poll on Monday, December 14th, 2020 to confirm the executive is still desired. This plan can also be cancelled at any point between now and December 18th, 2020 via Signal Request + Governance Poll in case the market conditions materially change.
