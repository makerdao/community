# Vault Compensation Plan Approval Poll

The Maker Foundation Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the community, which the community can use to signal whether to accept and move ahead with the proposed Vault Compensation Plan.

## Review

The Vault Compensation Plan was discussed in the [Forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2900) and presented on the [June 25 Maker Governance and Risk Call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2878). Voters are encouraged to review the plan document and discussion to inform their position before voting.

If you vote "No," it would be of great help if you could post on https://forum.makerdao.com/ to explain why you do not support the plan and suggest improvements.

## Next Steps

If this poll is decided as "Yes" then Maker governance will proceed with the series of votes and steps laid out in the Plan document, beginning with Phase 1.

If the poll is decided as "No" then additional discussion can take place in the forums to determine what changes are necessary to gain community support.
