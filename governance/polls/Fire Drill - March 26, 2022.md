# Poll: Fire Drill - March 26, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Immunefi Security Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for two days beginning on March 26 at 03:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The first line of defense for responding to a governance attack is to pass a canceling spell within the allotted 48 hour [Governance Security Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation) delay. The outcome of this poll does not matter since this is a test. However, to offer more realism, imagine that there is a malicious executive spell and you need to vote 'No' to cancel it.

Gas fees for voting on this poll will be reimbursed by Immunefi Security Core Unit.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the outcome of the votes, no further action will be taken.**
