# Ratification Poll - Declaration of Intent - Implement a Feature to Refund People who Lost Money Sending Dai to the Dai Contract Address (MIP13c3-SP14) - February 13, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, February 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP13c3-SP14 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This MIP proposes that people who passively and permanently lock Dai in the Dai contract have the ability to get their funds back. If people transfer their Dai to the contract address, and the contract address has the characteristic of being permanently non-transferable, then we regard it as permanently destroyed. When the Dai is regarded as permanently destroyed, it will be issued to the transferrer through the mint function in the smart contract. Maker should offer some kind of support for Dai sent to the contract â€” maybe with a 10% penalty to discourage abuse.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.
