# Poll: Increase the Surplus Auction Buffer to 2 Million DAI - August 10, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the Surplus Auction Buffer, also referred to as the 'System Surplus', from 500,000 DAI to 2,000,000 DAI. More information on this parameter can be found [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol#surplus-auction).

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 10 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, August 14, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3316) on July 23, 2020. Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.
