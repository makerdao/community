# Poll: Sai Stability Fee Adjustment - January 20, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Sai Stability Fee** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Sai Stability Fee** within a range of 5% to 13%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 20 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, January 24, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

The **Sai Stability Fee** was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, January 16.
