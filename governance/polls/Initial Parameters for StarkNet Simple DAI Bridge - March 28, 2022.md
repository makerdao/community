# Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge - March 28, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Starknet Engineering Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 28 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review
The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to implementing a simple bridge limit of 5 million DAI. The bridge limit is the maximum amount of DAI that can be in the L1 bridge contract. Hence it is the maximum amount that can be lost by users. This will not include the Fast Withdrawals component which is planned for release later this year and will be put through a separate governance process.

The bridge launch will require the completion of all the mandatory items on the [checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lg4LFQCW7x4bcR8gEgHoE7DB2rqa4GA4DPSUdMOgBsI/edit#gid=718243816).
Users will use the simple bridge at their own risk. It will be mentioned on the bridge interface.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Starknet Engineering Core Unit will proceed with the deployment of the StarkNet simple bridge once the listed requirements are met.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
