# Monthly MIPs Governance Poll - \$date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed the MIP3: Monthly Governance Poll into the voting system. This poll asks whether the bundled contents of this month's Governance Cycle should proceed to an Executive Vote to be held on \$executive_date. The bundled contents of this poll consist of:

- [\$proposal_name1]($proposal_link1)
- [\$proposal_name2]($proposal_link2)
- [\$proposal_name...]($proposal_link...)

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on \$date_DAY,\_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The proposals can be reviewed in this week's MIPs update [here]($discussion_link). It was also discussed on the latest [Governance and Risk call]($last_governance_call) on \$last_governance_call_date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY.

## Next Steps

MKR holders must vote to determine whether to accept or reject the bundle of proposals included within the Monthly Governance Poll, determining whether the bundle should proceed to the final ratification vote (Executive Vote) in the last week of the monthly Governance Cycle. The Executive Vote will be submitted on $next_executive_date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY if the Governance Facilitators confirm a 'yes' outcome of the Monthly Governance Poll on the next Governance and Risk call on $last_governance_call_date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY.
