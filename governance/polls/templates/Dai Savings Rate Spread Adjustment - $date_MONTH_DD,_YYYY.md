# Poll: Dai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment - \$date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents several possible **Dai Savings Rate Spread** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Dai Savings Rate Spread** within a range of $lower_bound to $upper_bound.

Details on how the **Dai Savings Rate Spread** parameter was introduced and its impact on the **Dai Savings Rate** parameter can be found in the following [threads](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/dsr-spread) on the MakerDAO forum.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on \$date_DAY,\_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **Dai Savings Rate Spread** parameter is usually not discussed explicitly on a weekly basis as this poll is a regular occurrence. Please review the [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to see if there has been any discussion on the vote this week to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result of this poll differs from the current **Dai Savings Rate Spread** parameter value in the Maker Protocol then this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
