# Poll: Add $asset_code ($asset_name) as a Collateral Type - \$date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding $asset_code ($asset_name) as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on \$date_DAY,\_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The proposed initial system parameters for $asset_code ($asset_name) are:

- Stability Fee: \$stability_fee
- Liquidation Ratio: \$liquidation_ratio
- Debt Ceiling: \$debt_ceiling
- Auction Lot Size: \$auction_lot_size
- Minimum Bid Increment: \$min_bid
- Bid Duration: \$bid_duration
- Max Auction Duration: \$auction_duration
- Liquidation Penalty: \$liquidation_penalty
- Dust: \$dust

- [Oracles Evaluation]($oracles_link)

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes, $asset_code ($asset_name) will be included in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

If this proposal fails to pass, $asset_code ($asset_name) will not be added to the Maker Protocol at this time.
