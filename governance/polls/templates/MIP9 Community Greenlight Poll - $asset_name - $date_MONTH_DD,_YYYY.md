# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - $asset_code ($asset_name) - \$date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY

## Description

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the asset $asset_code ($asset_name) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [domain teams](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP7/mip7.md#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list).

If greenlight votes exceed defer votes, this poll is to be taken as a signal to domain teams that MKR Token Holders have approved further domain work with the aim of adding $asset_code ($asset_name) as a collateral asset to the Maker Protocol.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on \$date_DAY,\_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please review the collateral onboarding application [thread]($discussion_link) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

The domain teams will use the outcome of this poll to inform the direction of their collateral onboarding work.
