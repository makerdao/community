# Poll: Add $ilk as a new Vault Type - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on $date_DAY,_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding $ilk as a new vault type in the Maker Protocol with the parameters below:

* Underlying Collateral: $collateral_asset
* [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee): $stability_fee
* [Liquidation Ratio](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio): $liquidation_ratio
* [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling): $debt_ceiling
* Auction Lot Size: $auction_lot_size
* Minimum Bid Increment: $min_bid
* Bid Duration: $bid_duration
* Max Auction Duration: $auction_duration
* Liquidation Penalty: $liquidation_penalty
* [Debt Floor](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-floor): $dust

Please review the following forum threads containing information about $ilk and the underlying collateral $collateral_asset to inform your position before voting.
* [Proposal Thread]($proposal_thread)
* [Risk Evaluation]($risk_link)
* [Smart Contracts Evaluation]($sc_link)
* [Oracles Evaluation]($oracles_link)

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* $ilk ($asset_name) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
