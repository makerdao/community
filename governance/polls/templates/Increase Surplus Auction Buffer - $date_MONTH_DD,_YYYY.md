# Poll: Increase the Surplus Auction Buffer - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of $pollOrigin. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to increasing the Surplus Auction Buffer, also referred to as the 'System Surplus', from $currentBuffer to $newBuffer. More information on this parameter can be found [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol#surplus-auction).

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on $date_DAY,_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

# Review

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

# Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.  If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then the Surplus Auction Buffer will not change at this time.
