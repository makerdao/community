Please review the following [Risk Evaluation]($risk_link) containing information about $ilk to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**
* $ilk will be added to the Liquidations 2.0 System by a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option, then no further action will be taken at this time.**
