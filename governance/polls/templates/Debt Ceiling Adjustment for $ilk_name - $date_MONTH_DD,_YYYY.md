# Poll: Adjust the $ilk_name Debt Ceiling - $date_MONTH_DD,\_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the $poll_source. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the $ilk_name Debt Ceiling from $current_ceiling million to $new_ceiling million.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on \$date_DAY,\_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.
