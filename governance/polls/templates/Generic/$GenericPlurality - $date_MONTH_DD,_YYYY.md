# Poll:$GenericChange - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the $poll_source. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on $date_DAY,_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a plurality vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option that you prefer.** 
- **If you would accept any of the options you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support for one of the following options:
* $A_Detailed
* $B_Detailed
* $C_Detailed
* $D_Detailed

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**The non-'Abstain' option with the most votes is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, this change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.
