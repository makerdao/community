# Inclusion Poll for $proposal_name - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which asks whether the proposal ($proposal_name) should be included into the Monthly Governance Poll.

If the **Yes** votes in this inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** when the poll ends, the proposal should be included in the Monthly Governance Poll. Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**. In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.

## Review

The proposal can be reviewed here: $proposal_link_forum. It was also mentioned and possibly discussed on the $governance_call link on $prev_governance_call_date.

## Next Steps

If the Inclusion poll passes, the Governance Facilitator(s) will confirm this proposals inclusion within the next Monthly Governance Poll on the Thursday Governance and Risk call on $next_governance_call_date. The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/Accepted/MIP3/mip3.md).
