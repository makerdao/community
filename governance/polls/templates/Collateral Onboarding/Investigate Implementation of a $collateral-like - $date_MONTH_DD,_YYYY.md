# Poll: Investigate Implementation of a $collateral-like - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Arbitration Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on $date_DAY,_MONTH_DD at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether a $collateral-like should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state) and [Domain Teams](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP7#mip7c2-the-current-domain-roles-list).

Please review the discussion [thread]($proposal_thread) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* A $collateral-like vault-type will be added to the [Collateral Status Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PDf_CzhGa7mLuOUfX6Bz3WrnCjDRhIjmu-vDZMMw4Qc/edit#gid=1077340672) by the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit.
* This $collateral-like will be added with a 'greenlight score' calculated using the outcome of this poll using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The Core Units and Domain Teams will use the Collateral Status Index to direct their work on onboarding new vault-types.
