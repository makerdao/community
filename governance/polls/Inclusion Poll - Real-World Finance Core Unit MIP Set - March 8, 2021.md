# Inclusion Poll for Real-World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) MIP Set - March 8, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed an inclusion poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP3](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should abstain.**

* The Governance Facilitator(s) will confirm the inclusion of these proposals within the next Monthly Governance Poll on the Governance and Risk call on March 11, 2021. 
* The Monthly Governance Poll occurs in week 3 of the [Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md).
* These proposals will only continue to the Monthly Governance Poll if the Core Unit MIP Set is also included.

**If the votes for the Yes' option DO NOT exceed the votes for the 'No' option by at least 3,000 MKR then this proposal will not be included in this month's governance cycle.**
