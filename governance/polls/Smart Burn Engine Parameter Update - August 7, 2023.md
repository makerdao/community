# Poll:Smart Burn Engine Parameter Update - August 7, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to making the following parameter changes to Smart Burn Engine:
* Increase [Smart Burn Engine Cooldown (`hop`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/smart-burn-engine/param-surplus-cooldown) by 4,731 seconds from 1,577 seconds to **6,308 seconds**.
* Increase [Smart Burn Engine Lot Size (`bump`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/smart-burn-engine/param-surplus-lot-size) by 15,000 DAI from 5,000 DAI to **20,000 DAI**.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/smart-burn-engine-parameters-update-1/21545) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
