# Inclusion Poll for Core Personnel Onboarding (Governance Facilitator) - May 11, 2020

On May 11, the Maker Community will vote to determine whether the subproposal to add [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/longforwisdom/summary) as a Governance Facilitator will proceed to next week's Governance Poll.

**Inclusion Poll Details:**

If the **Yes** votes in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of **No** votes plus the **Default Inclusion Threshold** at the end of the poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll.

Note that the Default Inclusion Threshold is set to **3000 MKR**.

In summary, if **Yes** votes > (**No** votes + **Default Inclusion Threshold**) = inclusion in the Governance Poll.
