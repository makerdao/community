# Poll: PSM Implementation Poll - July 20, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support for the implementation of the Peg Stabilization Module (PSM) proposal in some form, with implementation aimed for the end of July.

This non-standard weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, July 20 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The Peg Stabilization Module proposal discussion is taking place across a number of threads on the official forum. The initial proposal can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3045). 

Further threads discussing the issue can be found under the [pegstab-module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/pegstab-module) tag on the forum.

## Next Steps

The governance poll timeline for this issue can be found in this [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3204). 

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, further polls will take place on July 27, 2020 to determine the parameters for the PSM implementation.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, implementation of the PSM will need to either:  
a) proceed under the MIPs process and the Monthly Governance Cycle  
b) take place as an emergency action recommended by a Risk Domain team
