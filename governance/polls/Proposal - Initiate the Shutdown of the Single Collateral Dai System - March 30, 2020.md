# Poll: Should we initiate the shutdown of the SCD system through an executive vote on April 24th, 2020?

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to signal their support to initiate the shutdown of the Single Collateral Dai system through an executive vote on April 24th, 2020.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for seven days beginning on Monday, March 30 at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The rationale for shutting down SCD was discussed in the Governance call on Wednesday, March 18. Please review the [video](https://youtu.be/AIW7lFg6gBI), [forum thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-thread-scd-shutdown/1673) and the general [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- If this proposal passes, on the Friday April 24th, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
