# Poll: Adjust the USDT-A Debt Ceiling - November 2, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the USDT-A Debt Ceiling from 10 million DAI to 2.5 million DAI.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 2 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-delist-usdt-as-a-collateral-asset/4853) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this parameter change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.
