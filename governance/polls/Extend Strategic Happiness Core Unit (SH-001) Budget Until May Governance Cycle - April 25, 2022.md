# Poll: Extend Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Budget Until May Governance Cycle - April 25, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 25 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following: 
* Send a one-time transfer of 35,000 DAI to the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) at [0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550](https://etherscan.io/address/0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550) to cover the gap between budget cycles.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-extend-shcu-sh-001-budget-until-may-governance-cycle/14511) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote, as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
