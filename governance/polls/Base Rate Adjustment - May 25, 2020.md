# Poll: Base Rate Adjustment - May 25, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Base Rate** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Base Rate** within a range of 0% to 4.5%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 25 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, May 29, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The **Base Rate** was discussed in an online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/2380) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
