# Poll: Stability Fee Adjustment - October 28, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible Dai Stability Fee options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a Stability Fee within a range of 5.5% to 13.5%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 28 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, November 1, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, October 24. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
- **This weekly cycle of Polling and Voting will continue until the community believes that stability has returned to the peg.**
