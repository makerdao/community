# Poll: Onboarding PAX Peg Stability Module - August 16, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Growth Core Unit. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 16 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll is constructed to match the proposal negotiated with the Growth Core Unit with Paxos. This proposal is described [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/create-a-pax-psm/9683).

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following:
* Increasing the PSM-USDC-A Fee In (`tin`) from 0.1% to 0.2%.
* Onboarding and deployment of a new PAX Peg Stability Module with the parameters given below.

**Proposed PAX PSM Parameters**
* Fee In (`tin`): 0.1%
* Fee Out (`tout`): 0%
* Debt Ceiling (`line`): 500 million DAI.

_To read more about these parameters, visit [the PSM page](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-psm/) on the MakerDAO Community Portal._

- [PSM Parameter Signal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-tin-tout-parameters-for-new-psms/8789)
- [Delegate to Growth Core Unit Signal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-delay-the-governance-poll-related-to-adding-pax-gusd-busd-to-psm/8971)
- [PAX PSM Proposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/create-a-pax-psm/9683)

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* PSM-PAX-A will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
