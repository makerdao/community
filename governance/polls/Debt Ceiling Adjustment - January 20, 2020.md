# Poll: Debt Ceiling Adjustment - January 20, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to alter the **Sai and Dai ETH Debt Ceilings**. Voters are now able to signal their support to:

- Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 45 million Sai
- Raise the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 125 million Dai

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 20, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, January 24, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

Due to a recent surge in migration activity MCD ETH collateral type is nearing its 100 million debt ceiling. Similarly the Sai supply is well below the current 75 million debt ceiling.

As outlined in the "Debt Ceiling" section of the previously ratified [Migration Risk Construct](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmba2hpv3kcbjgzvlnv7xsogs3jenqdiqo3ffnktgqtepn) proposal, the Interim Risk Team is putting forth a governance proposal to increase the MCD ETH Debt Ceiling to 125 million, and to reduce the SCD Sai Debt Ceiling to 45 million.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
