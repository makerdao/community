# Poll: Add BAL as a Collateral Type - October 12, 2020

The MakerDAO governance facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding BAL (Balancer) as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol.

The proposed initial system parameters for BAL are:

- Stability Fee: 5%
- Liquidation Ratio: 175%
- Debt Ceiling:4 million
- Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
- Dust: 100 DAI

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, October 12 at 16:00 UTC.

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes, BAL (Balancer) will be included in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

If this proposal fails to pass, BAL (Balancer) will not be added to the Maker Protocol at this time.
