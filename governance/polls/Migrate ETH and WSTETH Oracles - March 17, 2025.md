# Poll: Migrate ETH and WSTETH Oracles - March 17, 2025

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.1_Operational_Weekly_Cycle-b189fa17-57a9-4d4e-9780-0ce4efd94211%7C0db30308) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 17 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Sky Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.9.2.1_Pause_Delay/a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0%7C0db30758e055) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
