# Poll: Stability Fee Adjustment - August 26, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible Dai Stability Fee options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a Stability Fee within a range of 14.5% to 22.5%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 26 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-executive-voting)) which will go live on Friday, August 29, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, August 22. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) and the online [discussions](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

* On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
* **This weekly cycle of Polling and Voting will continue until the community believes that stability has returned to the peg.**
