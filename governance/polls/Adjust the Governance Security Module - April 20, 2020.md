# Poll: Adjust the Governance Security Module - April 20, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to increase the [Governance Security Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation#1-introduction-summary) delay.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 20 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, April 24, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [Forum Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/revisiting-gsm-delay-dark-spell-social-layer-discussion/1937) and a [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-calibrating-gsm-delay-in-light-of-recent-market-events/1979) on April 8th, 2020 and April 14, 2020, respectively. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
