# Poll: Collateral Asset Priority for OmiseGo (OMG) - August 12, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed seven Governance Polls into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling), one for each of the asset types proposed for inclusion the Multi-Collateral Dai system when it launches.

In this poll, voters are able to signal their level of support for **OmiseGo (OMG)**. The total amount of MKR staked in the 'Yes' option for this asset will raise it up the evaluation priority list, the total MKR staked on the 'No' option will lower it.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) will be active for seven days beginning on Monday, August 12 at 4 PM UTC. After which, the results of the poll will be collected and final priority list will be presented to the community.
