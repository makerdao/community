# Poll: Dai Stability Fee Adjustment - December 2, 2019

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **Dai Stability Fee** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Dai Stability Fee** within a range of 0% to 8%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 2 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, December 6, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

The **Dai Stability Fee** was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, November 28.
