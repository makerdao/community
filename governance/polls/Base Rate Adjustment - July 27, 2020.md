# Poll: Base Rate Adjustment - July 27, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents several possible **Base Rate** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Base Rate** within a range of -4% to 4%.

Details on how the **Base Rate** parameter was introduced, and its impact on the **Stability Fee** parameters for each collateral asset can be found in the following [threads](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/base-rate) on the MakerDAO forum.

This weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 27 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, July 31 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **Base Rate** is usually not discussed explicitly on a weekly basis as this poll is a regular occurrence. Please review the [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to see if there has been any discussion on the vote this week to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result of this poll differs from the current **Base Rate** parameter value in the Maker Protocol then this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
