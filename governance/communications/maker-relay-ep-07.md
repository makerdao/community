## Current Events

### Vault Compensation Update

[Vault Compensation V2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/vault-compensation-plan-v2/3584)

This update (posted Aug 7 2020), breaks down the updates in the Compensation plan after the failure of the vote from July 13th-16th. New polls will be structured to differentiate between MKR voters opposed to a specific plan, or compensation in general.

This also lays out financial plans for funding and discusses some operating expenses.

The compensation that will be distrubuted to vaults will be in MKR instead of DAI. These main updates came with some goals & principles as well:

> "Completeness..Fairness..Consensus..Simplicity..Economic Soundness.."

### Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade

[Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-system-1-2-upgrade-timeline/3592)

This post contains technical details and a timeline for the poll/executive vote for this potential "simple system update."

> "With the amount of Dai outstanding in the Maker Protocol, if there were a price crash, there would not be enough liquidity available to manage a large amount of auctions properly. In this case, the circuit breaker is not the right solution as it is subject to the system delay in addition to other complications. The Liquidations 1.2 Upgrade will allow Maker Governance to control the total amount of Dai that can be in auction at any one time."

### Peg Stabilization Module (PSM)

Discussion around the PSM continues. Please see last week's [Maker Forum Deep Dai-ve](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-relay-ep-6/3517) for background.

[Thoughts On The Peg, And A Fundamental Problem With The Current Stability Fee Design](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/i3dac7/thoughts_on_the_peg_and_a_fundamental_problem/)

[raiden4](https://www.reddit.com/user/raiden4/) created this Reddit post cited by [FourthStreet](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/FourthStreet) in the [Maker Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/subreddit-repost-reducing-dai-redemption-value-to-fix-peg/3525), weighing in on how to fix the peg:

> "...the more immediately useful DAI is, the less Maker (and MKR holders) will benefit since the stability fees will tend to go down...
>
> Assuming we don’t want to hurt DAI usability (e.g by introducing negative rates or demurrage) and assuming the stability fees cannot be lowered any more...the only other piece in the equation is the value of redeemable collateral. If we make it slightly less than $1 (at global settlement), we can lower the price TO $1...."

[How much demand is there for DAI?](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/how-much-demand-is-there-for-dai/3535)

> [@OliverNChalk](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/OliverNChalk) asks:
>
> "How much demand do they see realistically?
>
> Do they envision a scenario where supply manages to outpace this demand (only using 0% SF and not introducing negative rates?"

### Lowering the Base Rate

[Interim Forward Guidance for Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/interim-forward-guidance-for-base-rate/3518)

> "With the base rate now at -4%, all collateral asset stability fees (except MANA) are at 0%. Despite this accommodative monetary policy, we have yet to see much improvement in the peg or additional utilization of available debt ceilings."

> [@monet-supply](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/monet-supply) turned a chat into a forum post, laying out some of the pros and cons of further reducing the base rate. Relating to [@hexonaut](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/hexonaut)'s post from last week;

### Real World Assets in the Maker Protocol

[Initial Thoughts and Questions for Including Real World Assets in the Maker Protocol](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/initial-thoughts-and-questions-for-including-real-world-assets-in-the-maker-protocol/3511)

[g_dip](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/g_dip) lays out an initial dive into this subject, elaborating on the point that;

> "Conceptually there are two ways two think of the structuring process that allows a token to represent a claim on an asset in the Maker Protocol:

> 1. Tokenize a claim on a particular underlying asset itself
> 2. Create and tokenize a debt instrument which represents a claim on proceeds of the underlying asset in the event of a liquidation"

[g_dip](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/g_dip) goes on to ask questions about the benefits, potential risks and outcomes, and general opinions on the subject.

In '[How MakerDAO can be a competitive lender in the Credit Tenant Lease marketplace](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/how-makerdao-can-be-a-competitive-lender-in-the-credit-tenant-lease-marketplace/3521),' [mrabino1](https://forum.makerdao.com/u/mrabino1) begins a discussion on how it may be sensible for MKR to be setting up a revolving credit facility for a Lender.

The comments are full of more useful information; answering initial questions as well as providing this [diagram](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/how-makerdao-can-be-a-competitive-lender-in-the-credit-tenant-lease-marketplace/3521/8) of the proposed structure for this general idea.

## State of the Peg 8-10-2020

![Peg](https://i.imgur.com/RDhmo7n.png)

- DAI peg still hovering above peg at ~1.016.
- For an in depth breakdown on the Dai price premium check out [Governance and Risk ep 104](https://youtu.be/ZLgbKyTHPY8?t=1826).

![Dai Supply](https://i.imgur.com/7fypvgt.png)

- Above 400 million Dai with more room in the ETH, BAT, USDC, and WBTC Debt Ceilings.

![VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/It9tl7E.png)

- Volume at around \$86 million this last week.
- Average VWAP (Volume-Weighted-Average-Price) places Dai at \$1.016

![ETH Vaults collateralization ratio](https://i.imgur.com/JSstHoM.png)

- ETH vaults collateralization ratio distributing towards higher collateralization bands like 300-350%. The majority of the debt outstanding is still in 150-300% buckets.

![Large positions in safer collateralization](https://i.imgur.com/f6hIIII.png)

- Some of the larger vaults have pushed the 300 bucket up significantly.

![Liquidation wall at $285](https://i.imgur.com/urLghRt.png)

- The first liquidation wall sits at \$285 for possible liquidations of 32 million Dai.

![Liquidation wall $242.9](https://i.imgur.com/Qg8SGlD.png)

- The second significant liquidation wall is at \$242.8 ETH, a 39% drop would coincide with 66 million Dai getting liquidated.

![WBTC Collateralization much riskier](https://i.imgur.com/n4PhD4w.png)

- WBTC Collateralization much riskier with the majority in the 150-200% bucket.

![WBTC Liquidation Wall at $9810](https://i.imgur.com/SrtT4xM.png)

- An 18% price drop would coincide with 46 million Dai getting liquidated.
