## State of the Peg

- Dai remains slightly above peg at ~1.008.
- Eth price fluctuations generally keep an inverse correlation. If vault owners are unsure about Eth’s price they are even less sure about opening leveraged positions.
- WBTC Debt Ceiling close to cap.
- Longer term rising trend in ETH vaults but short term additions mirror Eth volatility.
