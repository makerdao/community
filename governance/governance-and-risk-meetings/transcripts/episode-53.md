Welcome to the September 19th edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of community development at Maker and the... I forgot. I'm also the interim governance facilitator. Right. I guess I should add that to my resume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [#](#000023) / [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h00m23s) | Richard Brown    | Today, we are going to mix up the agenda slightly. We have some conflicts that we need to route around. We also have some special guests and this is going to be fairly exciting because we have some heavyweights in the room today. Fluidity is here and they're going to talk about their Tokenized Asset Portfolio mechanism that they released to the community. There was a blog post that went out recently, a paper that went out. There was some very high level discussions that went along with that post. In my mind, not enough discussions, so, because it was worthy of more investigation than it received, and so hopefully we can dig into some of the details today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I am going to skip governance until, like I said, the second half of the call. We'll start off with risk and then ... But before we get into that, let's talk about the standard preambles that we've all heard 53 times before, if you're an active listener.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So if you have a question or a comment, please feel free to interrupt us. If you have a microphone, just jump right in and ask your questions. If you do not have a microphone, find wherever the button happens to be on the UX that you're looking at, type your question into the side. David or I or someone else will find that question and we'll read it out for you. We're really interested in getting feedback from as many people as we possibly can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I've asked him to put large bold letters of good and bad with arrows on his graphs so I can follow them along a little bit better, but I'm not sure whether we'll see that today.

The highlight is, DAI supply is up a fairly significant amount. Collateral value locked also at a reasonable level. But the main thing is that some refinancing, some just re-uptick in activity given what's been going on lately with ETH price. You know, we kind of called this shot in the sense that as the stability fees lowered, if ETH price is doing reasonably or people are feeling reasonably bullish, you will see sort of this re-uptick in leveraging activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So we're just sort of recovering some of that lost interest in CDP activity before. So overall, I think a rather positive week is a good way of looking at it. What's really interesting is, this happened without sort of crashing DAI, which you know ... We can talk about that in just a second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So it looked like about 63,000 ETH. So keeping the collateralization ratio roughly ... overall, for the system, around 350%, which is a pretty reasonable level. As far as longterm trends, so basically, it's a very short timeframe blip, so it's not really going to show in the longterm trends just yet. But essentially, the pace of the amount of DAI being locked has started to tick back up again so we can keep an eye on that, and the amount of collateral being freed, still pretty flat. And then, same with draws and wipes, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

That's what you expect when you see more of that leveraging behavior. What is also interesting to note is, on some of these secondary lending platforms, so ... and you'll have to forgive the data sync was interrupted here, but essentially, when that 12.5% stability fee drop occurred, for at least a few days, there wasn't much of a change in activity. And so actually, that weighted average borrow rate for dYdX and Compound was above that stability fee, which meant that it was cheaper to open your positions on Maker during that timeframe, which is fascinating when that happens. That generally hasn't happened in a while and should get ... you can think of it as ARB'ed away by refinancings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So on the 15th, wasn't it like one single CDP or very large loan that just refinanced from Compound to MKR that was basically the majority of that blip?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But what was really interesting is it's not just the refinancing; it's also ... not necessarily new positions being opened, but at least old positions being reopened through new CDPs on Maker. So in addition to what's going on in the secondary lending platforms, which was basically just an ARB of those rates, there was also legitimately new DAI being issued and new activity on Maker. So yes, as far as the refinancing, but that was how it happened the first time as well, right? So we saw ... when there was that, you know, uptick in activity on Compound through InstaDApp and a large amount of refinancings from MKR to Compound. About four and a half million moved in one day, primarily through one or two large positions. So it's basically a flipping back, is the way that I see that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So basically, this DAI supply around the 16th was about 8.3 to 8.4 ... or sorry, 83/84 million. But in the last couple of days, that has ticked up further to about 86 million. So there's an additional like, 3 million worth of activity that's not necessarily represented here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So the DAI price in the last 24 hours ... Volume is actually kind of low, which is really interesting, so not as much DAI being traded. So these are legit, just new positions being opened. Not so much people then going and dumping that DAI immediately. Not as much people, you know, buying up DAI, which makes sense because when you have new positions being opened, there's not necessarily a ton of appetite for reacquiring DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So that's particularly interesting. It may still come down the pike in a couple of days, or over the next couple of days, but it is fascinating to see that that has not sort of cratered the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Seventeen million, pretty reasonable volume for seven days. Slightly higher than we normally see lately. But overall, that price was just below or at a dollar. So again, not a huge depressive effect on the price of DAI that we might generally expect or worry about. Yeah. Sorry, I'm going to be kind of quick today, but we'll kind of open it up to questions or things that people want to double-click on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| [#](#001051) / [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h10m51s) | Richard Brown    | Thanks for that. You get off scot-free. All right, so let's keep the momentum up. So Fluidity is here and this is fairly exciting. It's a great team. They're doing a lot of really interesting things and they have a long history in this space. So it's a great opportunity for us to start asking some deep questions and a great opportunity for me to try and understand what their paper was all about. All right, so Fluidity, who's going to be speaking for you today? You want to do some introductions? Let us know who we're talking to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We're all going to be presenting different components, so we'll just share. So I'm Mark Fernandes. I'm on the product team here at Fluidity. I've been in the digital asset space for a few years now. Prior to this, worked at a company called Noble, which was a bank that was facilitating settlement for OTC transactions in this space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Yeah, so thanks again for inviting us to present on this call. I think it's a really good opportunity just to share what we've been seeing in the decentralized finance and overall credit spacey think-through and present our ideas on what we think would be a really good inclusion to the MakerDAO system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Wanted to give a little background on who we are. So as you may know, Fluidity is the company behind the AirSwap project. AirSwap is one of the leading decentralized exchanges. For those who are not familiar with it, I encourage you to check it out. It's an absolutely beautiful product and I think it's one that's adding a lot of value to the decentralized finance community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And we basically turned our focus to how we can integrate capital markets into decentralized finance. And so for the past year we have focused on what applications and technology we could build to facilitate that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We actually integrated the use of DAI to for pay the interest to investors and actually allow investors to invest in DAI to buy security tokens. That was the first example of that actually ever occurring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So we've hosted several events. We had one earlier this year, which is our biggest event, called Fluidity Summit. And actually, during that event, the MakerDAO Foundation presented the plan around MCD, and Greg from the team presented his views, and we actually incorporated a lot of those views into the Tokenized Asset Portfolios that we'll present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And as we've tracked this over the last several months and years, really, is we've really seen that DAI becoming a cornerstone of decentralized finance. And we think that for us to grow as a firm, we want decentralized finance to grow. And in order for that to grow, we want DAI to grow as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And so we released Tokenized Asset Portfolios earlier this year under the intention of allowing synthetic assets to be used in MCD. And we think that's really going to be a way for DAI to grow significantly beyond what it already has grown to now and what it will be when MCD launches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And one thing that we've really focused on, as he mentioned, was how we can bring some of the first assets into the system. And one of the things that we've noticed that could be major challenges to that are ... the two main things are the oracles that will be needed to monitor the price and position data for any assets that's introduced, and also, all the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that the liquidation process can occur seamlessly, and that keepers are ensured that they're going to get the proceeds of their liquidations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Mark will go into a little bit more of why we chose US Treasuries and why we think that's a good fit later. We put this through the TAP structure and essentially went through a process of mimicking how this would work end to end in the MakerDAO system, in the test environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

One was ... and the first being the pledging process, so we bought treasuries and held that through a broker and custodian and created tokens to represent those treasuries or that TAP, that portfolio of treasuries. We then pledged that token to initialize a DAI credit line and we drew test DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And then we went through the process of withdrawing the DAI. So we returned the test DAI and closed out the CDP, and then sold the treasuries and burned those tokens. All of this we did over the course of a few days.

So maybe I'll just briefly walk through some of the legal mechanics, both in the version that we set out in July and then some of the kind of revisions that we've made since then. So it's critical, in our view, in introducing synthetic assets, to ensure a few things. One, that you need to ensure that the underlying collateral is not being repledged, it's not being re-hypothecated, it's not being sold offchain in a way that the MCD system can't detect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And so we introduced, as Britton mentioned, the white paper in late July. And that was really an effort to start the conversation about introducing synthetic assets in a serious way. And it was a serious effort to really design the legal technology necessary to facilitate synthetic assets being introduced to MCD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And since then, we've been in the process of incorporating that feedback such that we could really bring to market an application for MCD that was as strong and robust as possible.

And I think really the takeaway for this, at least at an initial glance, is that a counterparty who is using this system to borrow from the DAI system against their traditional assets, like treasuries, would begin with depositing those assets into the account of a regulated trust company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The custody has to be maintained in a way that's compliant, or is there some kind of mechanical oracle, like, onchain mechanism that proves that the existence of these assets-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I think, first, you have an oracle that will connect to the trust's custody account at all times such that the MCD system will know that the securities are being held there and that they haven't been transferred to a different brokerage account, for instance. And then ... So that's kind of how you ensure provenance while the CDP is open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If for instance, a sponsor could enter insolvency, declare bankruptcy and put a stay on all of the assets. The way that we're addressing that is by designating the keepers, so the holders of token that are being issued by the trust, those holders will actually be the legal beneficiaries of the trust account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So who would be in charge of accepting those payouts from whatever settlement occurred?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So it comes to resemble some of the other ... or sorry, asset-backed stable coins that are currently in the ecosystem. And I think that allows the Maker community to have comfort that there is always                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

One of the features that I really like in particular about the Maker system, in its current composition, is the permissionless-ness of the keeping process. In other words, that anybody, a piece of software, anybody in the world can participate and be a keeper, and do so on par with everybody else insofar as they have access, at least weather to exchange, offload DAI, whether that exchange be onchain or not. So is it the case here that the redemption flow that you just described is open to anybody, no matter where they are, or are there restrictions to which types of persons or legal entities can participate in that redemption process?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And assuming that Fluidity is in the picture, is solvent, then we'll happily just simply, return an equivalent amount of DAI for every token that's deposited. The trust mechanism that I just described is really a last resort, and that's simply there in the event that Fluidity is no longer in the picture and the keepers need some way to get value back for the tokens that they purchased. Because it's a regulated trust entity, they're going to need to do regular way KYC on the participants who are bringing that token back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So outside of that small edge case within an edge case, this system should be open to anyone who wants to redeem the token from us in liquidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Is it the case that [inaudible 00:29:04] should be open and relatively open except for, as you mentioned, some edge cases. Is there a difference in cost in order to participate in that system? Or is it the case for instance, that a U.S. person, with a U.S. entity, with a U.S. Bank account can be KYC'd by a U.S. bank, can participate in this process more cheaply than a person that is on no list that happens to be let's say, Korea or China or somewhere else in the world?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Let's say CDP gets liquidated, how long before the keeper actually gets paid?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

As Jeff mentioned, part of the process in liquidation would involve the keeper bringing the token to Fluidity or the trust that would then be able to provide them with DAI or USD in return for that token. That presumes that that entity, either the sponsor Fluidity, or the trust was able to liquidate the underlying collateral. We think that treasuries... We have a slide on this in a little bit, we think that treasuries are in fact one of the most liquid assets, the market depth for treasuries is enormous. And so we think that it would be very feasible for any sort of entity that needs to liquidate the underlying assets to do so in a very timely fashion. So we think that that could happen all in the same day. We don't think that the process would be much more lengthy than say ETH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We also think that there would be safeguards to prevent this from getting to liquidation. As the manager of the assets and the trust, Fluidity would be basically maintaining the fact that these assets are getting close to liquidation and we would be able to maybe facilitate any actions that need to be done in preparation for a liquidation. So it's sort of active monitoring, but if that was to happen, we think that this could be liquidated very quickly and avoid slippage or minimize slippage as you mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

There's the custodian, there's the trust, there's the exchange. So doesn't all of this leave less of a profit margin for the end users? And is there a way to get rid of some of these middlemen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think that it's ultimately a balance between reducing intermediaries and potentially, as you mentioned, increasing margins, but also on the other hand, using a system that is robust and kind of can maintain the integrity of the DAI system even in the event of a liquidation. And so the introduction of things like custodians and trusts, while perhaps not optimal from a margin perspective, I think is ultimately necessary perhaps for the entirety of the synthetic asset segment, but certainly at least for something like this in our opinion, to really give the system assurance that in the event that a CDP, that was backed by an asset like this liquidated, that the keepers would be made whole. And it really kind of, the introduction of those intermediaries is designed to eliminate some of the counterparty risk that is inherent to introducing synthetic assets. And so while it's not optimal, I think it's probably necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We talked through the liquidation process at a high level here, what we want to talk through now is the introduction of a new questionnaire to supplement synthetic assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [#](#003356) / [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h33m56s) | Britton Overall  | Yeah, back in July when we ran the pilots, it was around the time that the community had posted the onboarding guide, collateral onboarding guide. And we had taken a look through that and it was really comprehensive, it really helped guide a lot of the questions that we needed to ask ourselves in that process. But one thing that we noticed was that there were some some room for improvement after we'd gone through the process that we thought could be added for synthetic assets, and some important questions that we thought could be raised there. I'm posting a link in the group chat to a post that we did actually this morning about some of these additions that we are proposing for that, and we really bucketed these into three categories. One is around the risks that the particular asset is introducing, and some of the considerations that would be needed there to make sure that a particular asset is not too risky for the Maker system. The second is Oracles, so it's very important that any asset that gets introduced, that the position or that asset is held, can be confirmed. And then also that there is a data feed that has accurate pricing to know the value of that asset at any time, to make sure that it's falling within the collaterization ratio and the system as a whole is collateralized, and then all of that data is available. The third is liquidation, and I know we spent some time already talking about that, but the right structure needs to be in place for that to make sure that all of the scenarios that could happen in that process are buttoned up and the right mechanics are there, legal rights are in place. So we've posted some questions we could probably flip over just to show the post, won't go into all the details but essentially everything is the same on the tech section and the original financial section. We've added some other items which can be seen there in bold that we think are some additional questions that we might want to ask if there are other synthetic assets that are introduced. So feel free to take a look there, we welcome any feedback from the community on those. And again it's just our recommendation of some things and I'm sure there'll be many more questions that come up along the way as as more folks introduce synthetics. |

Is it because synthetic has so many real world interactions, as opposed to straight crypto?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Since there is, I know like when Jeff went over with introducing a trust and some of these outside third parties, making sure that that charge is in place and that the asset that being introduced can fall into those structures correctly. That's one of them. And then you know, given that a lot of this data is not going to sit on chain, it's going to set off chain, and need an Oracle to bring that on. Then all the details on how, how that data is generated and the availability of that data. It's important to know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

When we were originally designing that guide, we specifically designed it for crypto assets because we, at the time, we weren't expecting this level of demand from off chain assets this early in the process. Our original version actually had some sections on security tokens, but we thought that there was sufficiently unanswered questions that we weren't even sure how to structure it, so we structured it for crypto assets specifically. But this is great. We're definitely happy to have a kind of a first pass at what the process might look like for synthetic assets, so thank you for that and we'll be sure to give it a look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So our goal with this application and working with the larger Maker community, is to ultimately submit an application for treasuries using the TAP structure to be introduced as a type of collateral in the MCD system. Our position is that treasuries would be an essential or at least very, very important type of collateral to have within MCD. We think that in order for DAI to scale, it really requires users to be confident that DAI is backed by a sufficient amount of collateral, and you can really increase that confidence with DAI holders by backing DAI with a collateral that has a low likelihood of liquidation and we think that because DAI... Because treasuries are extremely stable, the likelihood of liquidation is very low. For example, in the 90... If you look at the 95th percentile of a one day movement of three month treasuries, it's less than 10 basis points. When you compare that to something like ETH, it's 16% so we think that treasuries are very, very stable, presents a very low liquidation risk and therefore maintains the integrity of DAI. However, as we've somewhat alluded to before, there may be scenarios, hopefully never, but we think there could at some point be a scenario where these assets, the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated and in such a scenario it is really important as we mentioned, for the underlying collateral to be liquidated. As I mentioned before, the depth of the market for treasuries is extremely large. The U.S. Treasury market is around \$15 trillion worth of treasuries, and a substantial amount is traded every day, so we do not think that there would be any issues in liquidating treasuries in a scenario of a CDP liquidation, relative to potentially other synthetic types of collateral which may present some liquidity issues. And then finally we think that when we introduce treasuries as a type of collateral, the Maker community will actually gain a lot more control over the supply of DAI and therefore be able to increase the control of the peg of DAI to a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

When there's a fixed rate of return, CDP users can really easily assess the economics of if it makes sense to open up or close CDPs because they have an understanding of what the rate of return of treasuries are relative to the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

There's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of volatility, and therefore it's tougher to make a judgment if it makes economic sense for you to open up or close your CDP. When you have a very stable asset, like treasuries introduced to this system which has a fixed rate of return, it makes that evaluation a lot more direct and a lot clearer. So the process of trying to maintain a peg of DAI to a dollar or some other peg is very, very... It's a lot more straight forward a process. So we think for these reasons, and there are probably some others where we think these are the most important, we think treasury should be introduced as a type of collateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

But we think that based on how users are using their DAI to get a return elsewhere, there may be a need to close the CDP, if the stability feed is too high. Let's say if they opened up a CDP in order to access DAI, and that DAI is really the only type of collateral that is used in another system to get a return, maybe it's important for them to keep their CDP open, even though the rate is high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

As we mentioned, as a company, Fluidity is very tied to the success of decentralized finance, and that means we're really tied to the success of DAI. So we really want to see this move forward and or we're open to working the community to really push Tokenized Asset Portfolios forward and enhance the system. So with that we'll...

And let's say, for the sake of argument, some significant portion of our collateral is generated in this process. Let's say that percentage is 80, 90% for the sake of argument. What then do you think differentiates the Maker's system for creating DAI from let's say Tether, or any other Fiat-collateralized stablecoins team, insofar far as a lot of the recourse and mechanisms start to look a little bit similar in this model, why do you think Maker continues to be a better left, more trust, minimize alternative to those systems in that role?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Even as I mentioned, even if treasuries do make up a substantial portion, that doesn't restrict the ability of other users to continue in the kind of current status quo method of a opening up CDPs against Ether or against other types of crypto native assets and so it's ultimately just a different option for potentially a different user of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Let's say it wasn't treasuries, let's say it was dollars and again the same question. Let's say the majority of the system relies on a system like this, or at least the majority of collateral is based on systems like this and only a minority is based on ETH. Now it's true, I grant you the point that we have access to other options, but it is defacto the primary way through which DAI is issued. How do you think a few... A third party looks at DAI and the asset from a risk perspective? I think it starts looking more similar to something like USDC, or do you think because... Do you think it's mainly the option having different forms of collateral?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I think another distinction though that should be raised against some of the U.S., Like USDC is the option to obtain leverage in DAI, which is not available in the kind of a USDC, at least within its own kind of operation. You can of course borrow something like USDC or lend it on something like Compound, but it doesn't offer you the option to obtain leverage on the same way that the Maker system does. So I think that is something that continues to distinguish DAI from the other stablecoins and the fact that you can do that permissionlessly and that the kind of the rates, and the thresholds, and the ratios are all set by, and will continue to be set by the community. I think we'll continue to distinguish this from something like USDC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We think that may be, there are certain applications that are really only focused on one type of stablecoin, only focused on accepting transactions in DAI. So it may be advantageous for you to open up your CDP in DAI. So I think as there are...There's growth in the ecosystem and there are use cases for DAI that the use cases increased for DAI, there may be reasons for you to use DAI over other stablecoins. And so this would provide you with a mechanism to do so, as an alternative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I know if it's backed by, let's say some stablecoin or something that does have a sort of counterparty risk attached to it, like it's [inaudible 00:50:25] or something, right. That risk does end up being part of DAI but maybe not as explicitly to the user. Right. I don't know. I'm thinking out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I think one, I think that there's always a... There's always some degree of theoretical regulatory shutdown risk, if you want to call it that, the kind of back-door risk and while it may not be as explicit with the kind of non-synthetic version of MCD, there are still regulatory choke points that I think could be exploited if a regulator truly wanted to throw a wrench into the Maker system and really even the broader kind of a theory, of a crypto system if they truly want it to. So I guess that is the first one. There's always that kind of risk that's present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And we think that the value of increasing the demand for DAI potentially significantly so, and doing it in a trusted and kind of stable fashion like we're proposing, is greater than the increased backdoor risk, if you will. But I do agree that there is a trade-off there,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And how far are you from launching this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And all of that has been published, is out there on GitHub. Obviously with some of the updates, that have been made, there will be some new build required to interact with the trust. And probably build in more comprehensive Oracles, once the risk team is, on the Maker side, really want to integrate those Oracles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So Fluidity, feel free to stick around if you want to, or feel free to bounce if you have to. But thank you for the presentation, it was very enlightening. A lot of really interesting questions, I'm looking forward to seeing how it integrates in the future. So thank you, guys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Was I understanding correctly?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In the event, in the 99% of scenarios of a liquidation, where Fluidity is performing, then they could simply deposit the token, and would receive an appropriate amount of DAI in return. And would very likely not need to get KYC'd or anything along those lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

DAI is no longer stable, and is not wanted. They want the collateral behind DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We would have the treasuries sitting in the trust. We would liquidate the treasuries and be able to give them back US Dollars, as an example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's been asset that's been trading for quite some time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We've gotten a significant amount of feedback, informally, following the release of the white paper, which has been incredibly helpful in rounding out the legal mechanics here. And in parallel with that, we've also been working with external counsel on structuring this, and getting assurance that it complies with all applicable regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And whether that's just informal, or through more formalized legal structures or panels, or things like that. Ultimately we want to get this right, so we're looking for as much feedback as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

They play it pretty close to the vest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We think that, at least with respect to those regulations, that this instrument complies with their frameworks. And we've also examined this under other regulatory regimes, and feel that it complies as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And so you just develop technologies that sometimes develop and grow faster than the rules do. So it's just a matter of the rules playing catch up, and evolving as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And so there's ultimately a balance that needs to be struck, but we think that we've come out on the right side of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

With Fluidity holding DAI under normal circumstances, that as I understand it, to redeem for TAP holders, Fluidity itself would end up with a DAI reserve during global settlement that they would have to cash in, and redeem for their proportion of the collateral that goes through global settlement, which would then potentially be useful for cashing out any remaining TAP collateral against the collateral taken from global settlement without having to liquidate the trust. It's not a question, Rich. I was just adding to the end of that conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We're going to talk about governance at a glance, but that doesn't mean that we're not going to ask questions.

Rune shared his thoughts on the value of stable coins as collateral. Basically useful for market makers. And a couple of other people made some comments on the downsides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So, again, just everyone is talking about that, trying to figure out where we should start DSR. Generally people seem to think between zero and five percent, which is a pretty big range. I'm sure we'll narrow it down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [#](#010945) / [01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=01h09m45s) | Richard Brown    | There's a summary I posted in that thread about the journey that we went on over the last couple of months to get to the decision to introduce exponential rate stepping to the stability fee. There's some interesting takeaways that we could possibly derive from this, around levels of debates, what we feel adequate consensus actually is. How do we measure majorities? All kinds of other interesting, or exhausting, philosophical questions that we've been wrestling with for a long time now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The short version of this story though is that the community has self-organized, established process, polled, debated, and come to a conclusion. Which is amazing. It's actually astounding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The contents of the governance poll has been determined. And it's now in the queue. So on Monday, Maker token holders will have the opportunity to change the way we determine, the way that we poll, for stability fees in the future. It's no longer linear, from negative four to positive four, of the current stability fee. It is exponential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So it gives us a finer grain tool for adjusting stability fees. It gives us the same latitude that we have in the existing linear world that we lived in. It also, and this is what I'm most excited about, gives us the opportunity to get rid of that .5 off the stability fee. Because that's a lot of typing week after week after week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The community, also, is applying this same work ethic to the cadence question we have around stability fee. Do we need to vote every week on this thing? The community is discussing that now. And there's a new thread in the forum, I would encourage people to take a look at, and make your voice heard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And currently it looks like people want to maintain the current cadence. So if you're one of the people that believes strongly that we should move to two weeks, or three weeks, or a month, or anything other than one week, go to that thread and vote, and discuss and share, and try and convince people that we should go to two weeks. Because otherwise, I think [inaudible 01:12:25].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And that's a hard one. There's no algorithm for determining that kind of stuff. So we're feeling it out. Whether the community, we, the royal we, arrives at the decision that everybody gets a week to figure this out, and if you miss that bus, then it's too bad, it's going through a governance portal anyways. That's one world we could live in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

That's referring to the debt ceiling. So this kind of came up before, and we discussed it a bunch. This was before we figured out a little more concretely what the process should look like. Basically a couple of people have said, both in the forum and in the chat, that it might be good to do a formal discussion, and signal request, relating to increasing the debt ceiling. So I've put that up in the forum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

How about let's just go with significant. Significant question that the community needs to answer about how much DAI are we allowed to have in circulation.
