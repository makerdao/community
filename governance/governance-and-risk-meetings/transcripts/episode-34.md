We have some things to go over today, some interesting developments in the world of MakerDAO. As always, we're going to have a chat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We're super excited to have everybody in the call, we have some deep thinkers and some people with some really great opinions and it's extremely important to me and the rest of the organization that everybody gets heard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If you don't have a microphone or if you're supposed to be working right now, just chat in the window and we will trawl for interesting questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Because there's a lot of really interesting freeform risk type questions that emerged last two or three calls and I want to keep that momentum going.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Then, we'll jump into Cyrus with the risk teams and we'll see what's going on with the peg. We will have a summary from Steven and then we will stick around afterwards and just chat about money and crypto and stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

All right, Steven, I'm going to hand it off to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Firstly, hello everyone, obviously welcome to... thank you for joining us and most of all, by joining us, you're contributing towards the governance of the MakerDAO protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Being engaged gives you not only line of sight, but it gives you a sense of exactly what it is that you need to contribute to and where that value may come from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Well, over the last couple of weeks, there's obviously been a lot of news in the crypto space and obviously, MakerDAO being on the forefront as one of the main components in the crypto space, we were obviously in that line of sight as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [\#](governance-and-risk-meeting-ep.-34.md#000230) / [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h02m30s) | Steven Becker      | And so what we basically have clearly established is the MakerDAO protocol is important in developing the crypto space and the DeFi space and understanding clearly how it is integral to it and how we need to establish a firm sense of, not only the DeFi space and our operation, because also the traditional space as well. But in that light, we need to be very cognizant of how stakeholders use the system, organizations integrate with the system and how constantly the system is always under review.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And the one item that we established over the last week or so was a security issue, one that was identified and quickly fixed in the course of business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And in that, is the responsibility of looking after the safety as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And soon enough and something that I think Rich can talk to, a post-mortem will come out where everyone can get a sense of what that issue was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And there, I think there's been quite a bit of improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And then lastly, again, just remember the third theme of this particular call is exogenous risks, things outside of the immediate system that we need to be cognizant of, in order to make sure it operates appropriately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I am going to post a link in the chat here and this is going to be a common occurrence as we go forward in these calls.

That discussion right now, until we find some better tooling, is going to happen in our MakerDAO subreddit. I just posted a link to the discussion thread for this call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Last week, should I break down the timelines? We were alerted to an exploit in the Maker governance contract from our friends and partners at Coinbase and Zeppelin and we released an update to the contract and a notification to our subreddit, that explained what the mitigation steps were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

There's a new update that has just been posted as of 12 minutes ago, which provides some additional color.

But what's most important to us in this call is the next steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

That contract behaves exactly the same way as the old one did, minus some functionality that was extraneous. So we're in a position now, where we can restart the governance process, because in this most recent notice we've published the source code and this is part of larger sort of crypto anarchic principles that we all sort of adhere to or at least we're building upon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The fact that the new voting portal contract is secure, they can take a look at the audit by Zeppelin, they can take a look at the audit from another team called TechShield, they can view the source code themselves on Etherscan and make sure that it satisfies their own particular requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And here's some things that I want to put on the table, because we're in this position where we have kind of a blank slate, when it comes to kicking off the scheduling and the cadence and the rate at which we do the polling and the voting cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I want to remain as agnostic as I can when describing the possibilities ahead of us and leave it up to the community to decide, but here are some of the things that we've been thinking about internally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If the peg is below, then the options available to people for the stability fee are in the positive integers. If the peg is above one, then we would flip that and we'd offer a poll with the range of zero to -4. That's the system that we have right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We ran into a situation where we were having trouble wrestling with the idea of what the current state of the system is or what the preferred state of the system is. We use a continuous polling mechanism and that means that there's traditionally two pictures of what MakerDAO could look like in the executive. One is the existing and/or old picture and one is the new and/or proposed picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And then that got ratified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And so it created this ambiguity between what is the preferred picture of the system, is the old state preferable or are people just getting on holidays or something? And just haven't gotten around to ratifying the new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Ambiguity is fine in principle, it's not fine if we need to have a poll the next day that's based on the picture of the system that everybody seems to agree on. So there's ambiguity here that we still haven't quite dealt with and it's kind of, in over the last few governance calls, it's faded into the background because we didn't run into this issue again. People have been happy to move the majority of the stake weights into the new executive, generally on Friday. Like I said, we haven't addressed this.                                                                                                                                                                              |

We've stopped the governance cadence, in order to update the contracts, we're in a position to restart them now and so there's options on the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I'm going to read out two options... sorry, Cyrus, did you want to jump in?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

There's been some ideas about how do we decouple the ranges that are in the polls from the executive altogether? So in a poll, you could just have -100 stability fee to +100 stability fee and then presumably people would just arbitrarily pick some kind of range or that range would be...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So the two options that we've been tossing around, in no particular order of importance, is we continue with the seven day cadence, where we... there's always a vote happening, there's always a vote or at least a cycle happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Guidance, that the community is ahead of this curve and as the rest of the ecosystem catches up and the peg begins to stabilize, we can begin to wind these things down and this follows the model, it is better to overshoot than to undershoot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The question here is, are we losing engagement with the executive on Friday, because people have sophisticated custodial solutions, their hardware wallets are locked in a safe in their office or some filing cabinet somewhere?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So there's some options on the table or we could have that seven day cadence and potentially start a poll on Tuesday and then have it run for three days, start the executive on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We could also have polls for two days, so we just start a poll on Tuesday, have it go to Wednesday, Thursday, on Thursday, have an executive and let that run to the next Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

What if we polled for a week and then had an executive for a week? That Cyrus, touches on the issue that you were just mentioning where we don't eliminate ambiguity, but potentially over the course of seven solid days, we have a much clearer picture of whether the executive was a clear winner or not or whether there was a lack of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Those are the two different camps that need to be addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

There's a possibility that there's additional confusion created by this 0% option, because it's weird when you think about it. Presumably, if somebody votes for a 0% option, they are signaling that they think the system is fine the way it is right now and we shouldn't change it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So it's worth considering that the options that we have in these votes, in the polls, are no change, as in no executive as the first option and then the second option is 1% increase, 2% increase, 3% etc. That would eliminate the need to have these extraneous executive votes that may be weak votes, that don't necessarily reflect the will of the MKR holders.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And they've actually been proven wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I guess we can avoid saying that the doves are wrong, wrong, wrong, but we could definitely look at the numbers and once risk and Vishesh come in with some input, come up with some kind of a rough consensus about whether the stability fee movements have been successful or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We could have the options of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% increases every two weeks or 1% increments, all the way up to eight or 16 or who knows? There's a lot of options on the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I just want to present the scenario where the stability fee is already quite high and the trend of a DAI recovery is really strong and obvious and we may want to lower the stability fee, even when it's below the peg, just to get in front of the curve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And if we can see a chart that DAI is trading up over a series of weeks, then we may want to get in front of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Thanks for bringing that up, because this is a risk that I failed to identify. I thought I was getting ahead of this. When we presented that 0 to 4% increase, it felt like an arbitrary imposal of a range from the foundation and I can assure you that is not what happened. It was just the numbers that were presented in a reddit thread, nobody questioned them, it encapsulated the range of all previous rate increases that we've considered in the past and it just stuck. And also, largely it's a UX issue, because having 8, 12, 16 different options in the polling interface is kind of a nightmare to manage and display.                                                                            |

So the actual display of that data is somehow influencing the way people voted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I'm not sure that we're in a place to dig into it yet, but I think that the general assumption is that over time, as we aggregate more data, as we have some more sophisticated models and the risk function has been fleshed out a bit more, that we will be at this situation where either we have an algorithm that gives us a temperature reading and then we use that algorithm to influence what the voting process-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think as we have these calls, we're figuring out what governance looks like for us and what I would hope the most conservative and cautious way humanly possible, until we get the confidence in the algorithms and implications of having, relying on computers to achieve homeostasis for a peg for us.

Obviously, you need like more modeling to be able to do that, so you couldn't do it today, but you could see that being something you'd trend towards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So just the broad-strokes to start, I think I have tried to hold a fairly conservative view up to now.

There were some sort of periods of up and down, Tether news etc, but broadly, in terms of volume weighted average, it's been holding pretty steady.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And then sort of in between in the variance, it's hit the peg at certain points and even shot above it, like the day of the Tether news. So for me, what this says is at least what's been going on with the DAI supply and combined with the stability fees has had a measurable impact and it seems that DAI is at least trading close to the peg and it's unclear if we continue to increase the stability fee, if it would necessarily reach the peg. But at the very least, it's definitely hovering close to.                                                                                                                                        |

We've seen this relationship I think hold fairly consistent and we've mentioned this a few times, ETH price being a big driver for DAI makes sense, in the sense that what's going on with ETH drives the sentiment and desire for leverage, which is a big use case for Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So let me just show that here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

That had shown an even stronger relationship. The reason that this to me is an important metric, is because it starts to speak to effectively in the short term, how cheap is ETH trading to what the long-term trend is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

What's interesting is I think this sort of relationship has held steady, but has been a bit broken recently and so DAI price, it's hard to say whether it's due to Tether news or whether it's due to stability fee increases, has maintained kind of its strength in the face of what's been going on with increasing ETH price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

But at the same time, DAI prices held relatively steady or even increasing in that time period. So whether that's due to stability fees or whether that's due to Tether news and other factors is very hard to say, but it is definitely a positive indicator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I think this is the most clear and measurable impact of the stability fee changes and then we can sort of talk about what's the relationship between DAI supply and DAI price? And I think that's a little bit more complex, but it is to me, fairly clear that the increasing stability fees has had an impact on DAI supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Effectively, I think the circulation of debt has improved with the recent increases in stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But essentially, as the stability fee has come up, for the first time in basically ever, the average age of debt that is open has been decreasing and the average age of debt that's being closed is increasing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So effectively that means for the first time, people are okay with... there have not been very many liquidations recently, so it's mainly driven by wipes.

So that to me is a very important health indicator for the system, because I think it will be important to maintain a strong circulation to achieve homeostasis as Rich mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So effectively, what this says to me is the Dharma, Compound, NEO was mentioned. A few of these kinds of platforms have really nestled into that secondary lending relationship with Maker, where people would tend to refinance their loans onto those platforms or would instead try to purchase DAI and lend it out on those platforms.                                                                                                  |

But what is interesting is the amount of DAI that gets locked up in those platforms, that is not necessarily lent out is generally a positive for the circulating supply. And then a positive in the sense that it's good, but it's a negative. And then the other factor is, if people are taking out loans and refinancing them on those secondary platforms, that does not have an overall effect on DAI supply, but could be a positive for DAI price. |

The collateralization ratio, so this has been interesting, where as I mentioned, DAI supply has been consistently going down, but the collateralization ratio has been kind of consistently increasing over the past week or two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So the amount of frees has been outweighing the amount of locks recently. So effectively, people have been taking more collateral out, but not as much as the DAI supply has been decreasing, which kind of makes sense, in that people are going to hold their collateralization ratios within a relative range. But they've been okay with deleveraging the amount of DAI that they have relative to that ETH.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So this is potentially a sort of intermediate variable that we can observe, that is not the independent driver, but definitely, I think has a relationship to what's going on with DAI price. And that people are sort of maybe letting their foot off the gas a little bit, in terms of how much leverage they're seeking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And is that equivalent to the age of a CDP? So maybe you could talk a little bit about your methodology on how you calculate that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So a CDP, like often CDPs could be opened early on and have very little activity and so in that sense, that CDP would be very old, but if a large quantity of debt was drawn recently, the debt, the age of the DAI would be very low. So they're not the same at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And I have some thoughts about... I mean I know there's been a lot of open discussion on how high the stability fee has to go before DAI hits a dollar.

I think time is an important variable to look at here too, because like there is a very real consideration that in the long term or over a reasonable time scale, DAI would not sit at $1, but we know like in short time bursts, DAI does hit $1 or go above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We haven't seen it happen up to this point, that given the transaction costs that are involved, that DAI or the risks involved, DAI might not necessarily be ever equal to \$1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And here's where I like to tell everybody, please explain it to me like I'm five. So is this primarily the friction of getting the premium associated with the friction of getting in and out of DAI, is the reason why perhaps 98.9 or whatever is the real price of DAI?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

I mean one DAI is not quite literally $1, it's designed to track $1 and if there's always going to be that lapse in confidence, that little gap where these two things aren't identical in makeup, then there might be some risk premium there that needs to be filled up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It has to do with demand though, so if people are using DAI as collateral or as a transaction or a settlements token or something, then yeah, there's a lot of friction there. But if somebody wanted to get paid in DAI and pay their subscriptions in DAI, then that becomes a significantly different picture, doesn't it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I don't know, doing something with the stability fee, maybe some would argue to not increase it anymore or maybe some people think we're still on the right direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And so like the more time that we have to observe what the impact is of the stability fee, versus ETH price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I think the trend is really strong at the moment, we've sold a bunch of our DAI at some good prices and obviously, DAI supply is coming down. I think to keep raising it from this point, when the trend is this strong, but I would look at the trend and use that as the guide, the DAI price has been coming up, things seem to be working at current levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think we have good reason to just be more steady at this stage and see if the trend holds, rather than constantly ratcheting them up, which is going to have some other effects on the whole ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Because I'm not personally seeing where there is significantly large risk in overshooting the stability fee. And then ratcheting it back down, if we do determine that we've overshot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So I think, yeah, it would be more about just like managing the liquidity of the system at this early stage, that like everybody, Maker, we and a bunch of other people are still sitting on a bit of DAI, but as soon as that's all gone, I think you will start seeing it trade above \$1 or at least trade on really thin books, which is probably not what we want at this stage.                                                                                                                                                  |

I think it was kind of the reactionary approach that got us into this situation in the first place, where Maker's inventories went to zero in December and the stability fee was at 0.5%. It took us a very long time to get the stability fee back up to a reasonable level, even though the trend around supply and demand for DAI was pretty strong for four three months or so.                                                                                                                                                                         |

And if that's what's necessary over the medium term, then rather than continually ratcheting it up, when we've got a strong trend in the DAI price improving, I think we can just sort of hold it steady and not put ourselves too far in one direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I think it's a lot easier to incentivize kind of the more general non-market making retail to generate DAI to sell it above \$1, than it was too incentivize the reverse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And right now, we only have about roughly 20 million of debt ceiling room. That could easily get cleared up in a couple days under the right scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I think the governance could become a lagging factor there.

So that's a big problem. We would need to have some kind of a robust polling or push method that would allow us to contact stakeholders and put this stuff on their radar. Or else we would have to like really promote this assumption that as a MKR holder, it's your responsibility to do like daily check-ins on what Maker's up to. I'm not sure that's reasonable.                                                                                                                                                             |

Like even if you made the same kind of magnitude of changes in the stability fee, because the arbitrage case is so much clearer when DAI is trading above \$1, I do agree with Cyrus that it is much easier to walk it down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So it's like if you have access to open books from some guy who is doing OTC trading in transparent way, the quantity of inventory that if he's getting too much DAI, then it's like probably the peg isn't going well. And so one can shoot for like half of the capital in DAI and half of the capital in dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And I think it's showing that the governance fee is still a bit too low, because it's not cleared yet.

So it's stable according to this graph and then we factor in the fact that there's this X amount for less than a dollar for sale on Coinbase Pro and this is the general sense of the inventory levels across four different market making desks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The specific like depth of the order book at any given point in time is to me, just like an increased degree of granularity, particularly on a time scale of like what is going to happen to the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So that kind of thing is where it could be a leading indicator, but I mean I think first and foremost, it just tells you how liquid DAI is, is the most important thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

That's what I was trying to lead into earlier with, I don't know for sure, I don't think anyone knows for sure whether or not DAI can hover at $1 with DSR or without the DSR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I mean 100 basis points is better than most financial institutions out there. If we make it anything significantly greater, we take a chance at having there be so much demand, which is a wonderful problem initially, but we need to step our way into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So the equivalent of a yield to maturity calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I guess at the end of the day, the real point here is that when you're having a DSR or the stability fee, at the end of the day, you're just trying to control supply on one side of it by either incentivizing the removal of supply or penalizing the creation of too much DAI. We're just going to have to find that balance in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And the overall stability fee to borrow against your asset will ultimately one day, in five years, probably be lower than what you can get at a commercial bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Or do we accelerate the decompression of the... accelerate the stability fee decrease?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We're just going to have to try those both together, but I think the ultimate objective is to lower the stability fee back down to normal, more reasonable levels. But we don't want to destabilize the process by causing spurts in demand that causes to be more erratic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I mean there's an argument that MakerDAO is a sufficiently different beast that it comes with its own set of pros and cons.

You can just be someone who bought it and is using it, choosing to use it in that same context. If you choose to buy it and then store it in the effect of a short-term CD that has a yield, much like a savings account, I think we should compete with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And ultimately, it's not like anybody gets to decide. I think pretty much everything is market driven.

For a DAI holder, DAI holders aren't necessarily concerned as to whether their actions are affecting the Maker system as a whole. They're just looking for the best possible yield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So for example, with Dharma you get collateral back, when you deposit DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In the context here, we're talking about like the DSR is actually removing circulation of those tokens. Dharma is not really removing them, they're just allowing you to earn a yield and charge in other yields as they lend the money back out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I mean even if a bank may generate more yield, treasuries and themselves still have command, there's still a demand for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So is there a margin of safety in place when you're lending through Compound, that if the borrower's collateral falls below a certain amount, can it be liquidated in time and cover the debt?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And then the other thing is, on platforms like Compound, yes, there is a small amount of counterparty risk if somebody does not have sufficient collateral due to price changes. But I think the risk of that, I haven't pulled the date on this just yet, but I think the risk of that has been practically relatively low. So I think it will just be about whatever is the highest yield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The more that we increase the DSR, whatever we start at, fine, X. Ultimately, we're going to be able to pull the aggregate stability fee down. At the end of the day, we're going to find ourselves, I believe we're going to find, the secondary lending platforms are going to basically be boiled down to whatever stability fee/DSR that Maker ultimately sets, because it will be the trend setter, not really the trend follower. It's just a question of when those happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I don't know the answer to that, but at some point if we set the DSR to X and then have to make it 2X to make it more competitive and the stability fee as an overall factor can drop from 16 or 19, whatever it is, down to say 10 and then down to five and then as we slowly pull the DSR in, the challenges with those secondary markets is that they're going to in effect be squeezed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Then, we bring up the point that you're mentioning of, how do we set our rates? We just don't want to get ourselves in a feedback loop.

I think there's two separate points, one is what happens given a DSR level, compared to external lending rates? And then the other is, how do those external lending rates respond to the DSR and the stability fee?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If we start to set the stability fee or the DSR based on those lending rates and those lending rates are not subsidized and are set based on the stability fee. So that's a really good point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It's very clear that lending DAI on various platforms does not carry the same risk in a multitude of ways. This is also one of the main issues I have surrounding the DIPOR rate and I think they have been part of some conversations about this offhand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If you lend out DAI on Dharma and accept ETH as collateral, versus accepting some other random coin as collateral, there should be different rates offered for the DAI loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I am not one, but I'd be curious why in many cases, so I've been told, that there's some significant quantity of market-maker DAI that's hanging around. If any of those folks have decided to put those quantities into a secondary market lending structure to make some yield off of it and or their sensitivity/desire to use the DSR to generate an equivalent yield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

That would make me feel more comfortable as a market maker, as opposed to putting it on a secondary platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
