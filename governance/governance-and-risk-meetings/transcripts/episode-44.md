Welcome to the July 18th edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the Head of Community Development at Maker. We have a special guest today in the form of Alex Evans from Placeholder VC. We're anxiously looking forward to hearing from him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So, hopefully, there'll be kind of like a preamble for that. Otherwise, I'm just going to nod sagely in the background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

There is a fantastic amount of things in governance and all of that is going to be carpet bombing these meetings over the next couple of weeks of some presentations, some request for comments, some new forum debates about ways that we're hoping the community can come together and help us to optimize this process. Because believe it or not MCD is a real thing and it's coming soon, so we have a lot of work to do.                                                                                                                                |

The first stage is to make our foundation, puts all the pieces in place. Many, many, many people get all their work finished and then the work depends on the community. Largely people that show up in this room, people that are showing up in the governance forum, but we have to rely on the community to help us do a great deal of work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We need to talk about what the voting cadence looks like. We need to get piles and piles and piles of feedback. For that to happen effectively we're going to need to formalize and internalize some of the emerging process that's coming out of the forums and that's going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. To early to talk about it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

One of them is the discussion thread for this call. We'll continue the discussion there after this has ended. David will provide us with a summary of all the salient points. There's a link also to the thread for Alex's model. There's also a link to something that LongForWisdom is turning into a forum rockstar for us has been posting ... is this the first of the second I'm not sure. I'm hoping it's the first of many [crosstalk 00:02:40].                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Anyway, it's a very valuable 10,000 foot view of what's happening in the forums because the forums are taking off in ways that I can only have hoped for. Lots of really interesting governance stuff happening in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And then, we talk about what happened in that forum in these calls. We surface some things, we prepare the community for signals, and we do some educational materials, but largely the heavy lifting happens in those forums. So if you haven't gone, I advise you to check it out. Tons and tons of valuable content. I'm hoping that it'll have enough bandwidth to get caught up with it maybe on the weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We have lots of things to do. I've already touched on that a little bit, but lots of things to do, lots of people that need to do it, and we need to figure out how that works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We've been doing that for 30 years now. Its called Opensource. The tools are available. And so, this is one of the things that I want to start discussing more and more about, how governance works, how these calls work, how the forums work, how the community development group in general works. How that works is Opensource. The heavy lifting has been done here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

But when it comes to the mechanics of how distributed teams of people work on the internet, especially in our space, it's all been nailed down. People talk about things in forums. They talk about things in chats. They get together in GitHub basically. For better or for worse that's what we have and then they do their work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And then, that works goes into GitHub. And for our purposes the distinction between slow decode and documents, a framework, a model, a Python script that approves that model is a very thin distinction. So, we're doing the same thing. We have these tools available to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

That model I'm hoping looks like this. We have a few different venues and those venues serve very clear purposes. We have a forum. A forum is where the debate happens, where input is gathered, and where documents are initially drafted and hammered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And then, when they're in GitHub they become and issues and then that's the final process for adding people's inputs. It's sort of like an EIP process. Once that document is finished, the PR gets accepted, it goes into GitHub proper and that's where this GitHub becomes a document, a very loose content management system for us.

Our proposal comes out from some organization or group of people. Then we move into our request for comments phase. Then we move into this version control committing phase. And then, we display that data in a presentation later somewhere. We'll be digging into this a lot more over the course of the next few weeks. I just want to set the stage for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And so, what I'd like to do in this presentation is to describe some of the thinking that went into that model and also some of the core mechanics and assumptions that drive it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

First, I'm going to give a little bit of context and background. Then I'm going to give a brief overview of the model and some of the assumptions behind it.

Now that I think about it, too, I don't think there's a need for a lot of context. I think Cyrus, Vishesh, and some of the members on this call have done a pretty good job of setting the framework on what risk is, how we should think about risk, how we should model risk, what are some potential frameworks that we can use to formalize our understanding about risks. I don't want to repeat any of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

There's really three reasons why we went with this approach. The first one is it just gels really well with the way that smart contract based financial applications work and architected and that they are ... they're build on Ethereum that's a state machine and so they think about the world in terms of states and transactions representing transitions from one state to another. What these models allow us to do is they incorporate this idea of state and state transition very naturally and intuitively with very few assumptions.                                                                                                                                        |

When we come to MKR we really care about let's say how long a loan stays open or whether a loan is bitten or is liked or ends up in some other state. And so, that is a perfect application of that kind of framework because it's built for those kinds of derivatives and financial instruments that have these state dependent pay offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You can play with it and create new assumptions of your own and see how the conclusions of the model change depending on how you alter the assumptions.

In fact, I think it's a good exercise to try and go in and tweak some of these. We can have really any unit of analysis here. We can use individual broad transactions. We can have a discrete state space, continuous state space. This state space's a bigger one. A smaller one actually in the next slide. I think I'll contract the state space a little bit. It can be Markov, non Markov, homogenous, nonhomogeneous. It can be continuous time, discrete time, whatever. And so, that's really one of the core intents of the model. |

If you don't understand something it's my fault not yours. Please stop me. The way this model thinks about Maker is it thinks about Maker as a collection of loans primarily.

You can go from safe to unsafe. You can't go from safe to bitten. You have to go to unsafe first. But you can go from safe to wiped. From unsafe you can do to pretty much any state. And then, once you get to wiped then you see there's no arrow leaving those states.

They're what are called transition rates. What these rates allow us to do is they incorporate a notion of probability, the probability that you transition from one state to another, but they also incorporate a notion of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If a loan closes having been open for a month that's very different to it closing after it being open for a year. Presumably in the later case it grew significantly more stability fees. Hopefully, that's clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

First, they're organized in this matrix called the generator matrix. It's just it can be a way to organize the information. That's the best way to think about it right now. Here we see, for example, rate from safe to unsafe as this QSU. From safe to wiped is the QSW. And the way these are defined is the diagonal elements ... oh, and by the way, wiped and bitten are all zeros. There's no notion of transitioning from wiped to unsafe for example so that's zero.                                                                                                                                                                 |

The transition rate out of the safe state, which is what this first one, one entry is here, is just the sum of transition rates to safe, unsafe, wiped, and bitten. The transition rate out of safe is the transition to you can only transition to three states, so the sum of those transition rates is that transition rate you get here. It just convention to do the negative of it, but really you ignore the minus sign. That's the transition rate out of the state.                                                                                                                                          |

Actually, these transitions do occur in practice. You do see loans going actually doing this oscillation a lot. That's just a side note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

One of the ways and I didn't mean to scare you with all of these formulas here, so just ignore them. I want to note just one thing with this slide is every single one of these formulas that represent either global or local state you can compute with just these six assumptions. Actually, just as Cyrus just noted, it's actually five. You only need to compute these five rates and then anything here you can compute directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Or in the very, very long-run equilibrium of the system at what level does the number of loans stabilize? Or what is the total liquidation fees between now and some arbitrary point T, like in a year from now? How many stability fees do I get between year two and year five? You can get that in this formula here.                                                                                                                                      |

You can get really, really far. If you get good estimates of these parameters, you can make pretty good prediction about other parameters in the system whether they be local pertaining to individual loans and the risks associated with them or global parameters that have to do with the overall state of the system.

This O is just your refusing the state space for safe and unsafe and just calling it open. Everything that's safe or unsafe we kind of just treat as one and we call it open and so then we just have three states open, wiped, and bitten. It just simplifies things. It's not necessary that you do this, but it's just a way to convey the insight a little bit more clearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We have this open to bitten transitions rate and we estimate that condition on the value of this covariate for the collateralization ratio. This is a factor variable that is coded zero if the collateralization ratio is above 280%, it's coded one if it's be 250 and 280, and then it's coded 2 if it's below 250.

We go into some of the intricacies in the actual paper, but the idea here is, for example, the stability fee you see this 72.4 here, 72.39. If we were to increase the stability fee by 100%, not multiplicatively but at 100% to this stability fee by one, we would see an increase, the model predicts an increase in the rate at which loans are wiped by 72 point .... Sorry. By a factor of 72.4, which means that all of those would pretty much be wiped out of the system within day or something like that.                                                                                                               |

So additional values of the covariant. For a given pool of loans what percentage of them do we expect to, for instance, be bitten is what we're trying to do here. And this is what's called scenario stress testing sometimes. Let's say for above 280 this is above this is this green line so the probability will be a really small probably the loss is small. Probability of largish losses all the way to very large losses is extremely small. You have this peak here what this is around 17 and that's probably that 1% standard deviation where you get most of your liquidations happening.                                                       |

You can see that a bit more clearly here. The probability that your loss will be contained at the 60% level is quite small, but the probability that they are quite large, they're contained at the 85, that they exceed that 85, is quite high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Now, in order to get the actual quote/unquote loss ... also great question. In order to get the actual quote/unquote loss you have to have an additional assumption about what amount, what percentage of CDPs fit in below what level. You need to have a distribution over what's called the recovery rate. Of the CDPS that are bitten how much are below 100%? Then also what is the recovery rate should they be below 100%? Then you can actually talk about dollar amounts or how much the MKR holders truly lose. That's a really good question.                                                                                                                                           |

One, by the way on GitHub we shared with the GitHub page both the codes were run all of these in generating all the results of the estimation and graphs and also the data. If you look at the data that Vishesh was kind enough to contribute it also includes the collateralization ratios at bite of every loan that was bitten. And so, if somebody were to do that exercise and try to do it well that would be where I would start because it'll tell you what the collateralization ratio of that bitten loan was.                                                                                                                                                |

The only issue is you really haven't had uncollateralized loans and so all of that is kind of guestimation. You could try to project based on that distribution, but we have a whole bunch more of like what is the probability it ends up below certain number. That's probably how I would do it. It's just we haven't. We've been quite conservative in terms of collateralization ratios and the liquidation system has worked sufficiently well. We haven't seen great example of that happening and so it really is an exercise in conjecture.                                                                                                                                           |

The other one is though for security tokens that may be a little bit different and we haven't seen them used in DeFi as much. While with other tokens we could for instance look at Compound loans and how those have behaved over time and whether there've been liquidations there and how that system has behaved in response to it. We can see some examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I mean, certain collateral types they'd be completely different, right? Certain like binary type of assets where one day they're just going to collapse to zero or whatever.

Their estimation shouldn't be that different because really the system cares the state. It says, what state are we in right now and what states will we be in in the future? All you need to do as an analysist is step back and say, okay, what's the probability that we'd get to that state?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

But how much people shore up capital in their CDPs versus taking it out when asset prices go up versus down I would say would be more standardized across different assets as more of a behavior function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And then based on that matrix go back and compute what the true risk neutral price of MKR is.

We're trying to think about how do we maximize our risk adjusted return as MKR holders and it turns out that the actual answer to that is similar to the answer to, what is the best way to manage risk in the system?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

That was enormously valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

All right, so just to bring you back to some numbers after all that theoretical goodness. As far as the DAI price, I mean, so right now volumes trading at like 5.6 million. It's been considerably higher than that over the past couple of days. The spread is kind of waffled around 98, 99 cents for the last few days. I'll just touch on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I think quite a few people expected things to be going a little bit better especially with the stability fee increase. It's interesting for us to dive into a little bit more of the like holistic measure and what's been going on instead of just looking at like price stability in the silo because things can get a little bit oversimplified and actually by extension a little bit confusing if you just try to look at stability fee price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Then there's a bit of this dip just at the beginning of July and a slight trend down with the 17.5% stability fee increase and the 18.5% stability fee increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Sorry, with the 17.5% decrease, there this kind of initially this narrative that at 19.5% the state of the system's too expensive. DAI was trading above a dollar at times. And so the stability fee really needed to be decreased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Again, the stability fee does not inherently fix the DAI price. It doesn't inherently bring the DAI price down. It just improves the sensitivity of the system to what's going on with leveraging behavior and by extension ETH price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The problem is some people given where the price of ETH has gone may be unwilling to give up on their positions at this time or they may have been liquidated out and thus they don't have to buy any DAI because they've already been liquidated. If those liquidations happen at sort of effectively lower DAI prices then you'll have kind of missed out on some that upward price pressure.                                                                                      |

Just because things seem fine at the 19.5% stability fee because ETH has not been stressed in that time doesn't mean that it's necessarily time to lower the stability fee. And vice versa if it was increased to 17 and 18.5% it doesn't necessarily mean that price is going to recover tomorrow. You need actual movement in the trading ploy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I don't think the preemptive stability fee changes approach, which is basically what you're getting at and what's been discussed a lot, is necessarily scientific is what I'll say. You could certainly choose to try to manage the system by guessing what's going to happen with the ETH price, but if you just try to manage to the level of confidence that you have ...so what I'll say is if you think that the system does not have robust enough transaction going, does not have robust enough holistic health in terms of level of leverage, amount of sticky demand, amount of oversupply, then you should be more weary of having a lower stability fee.                                              |

I think the problem is you have to be mindful of how much you're opening up the system to fluctuations in ETH price based on things like the level of organic demand, right? If you have a greater degree of oversupply what that's effectively saying is ... demand is a non monolithic concept, right? Demand is basically a curve of stickiness. And so, if you have a lot of DAI that's been draw out on fairly transient demand in terms of people wanting short term leverage, you really should just count that as oversupply.                                                                                                         |

If you try to move the stability fee every week to try to counteract every price pressure, you're going to be chasing your tail.

Overall this supply had been consistently growing for quite while around that like 90 million, 92 million level. There was a lot of these problems with DAI price.

During that period supply came down to like 82 million and then the stability fee was lowered as we just talked about to 16.5% and supply sort of started to grow pretty consistently topping out 91, 92 million.

That's again another reason it's hard to try to make bets based on what happens with ETH price because strong movements in both directions can actually end up having similar effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This is where correlations start to become really difficult because the stability fee was increased do to instability in DAI and Instability in DAI was due to ETH price. If you try to sit there and just make the correlation of stability fee was increased and then supply went down you might draw the wrong conclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

There is probably four or five million DAI that was wiped during that time, but a fair portion of it was also do to what was going on with secondary lending platforms and a fair amount of refinancing to Compound, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Now I'm glad that model was out there and hopefully people understand this concept a little bit better. As this stability fee changes you see often a significant impact in what's going on with the circulation of debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

With the successive stability fee increases earlier in May the ... I'll just go for context here. The age of debt had kind of consistently been rising accumulating a lot of ... and this tracks with the sort of unpaid stability fees graph, so consistently growing and outpacing the extent to which loans were being liquidated or paid back.                                                                                                                                                                       |

And then, with the 16.5%, 17 and then 16.5% drops that sort of started to stagnate. And then you started to see with a lot of refinancings and the success of secondary lending platforms in this sort of May, June timeframe, you did see some decrease I the age of open debt. A lot of that was new debt being created, yes, because the supply was also growing during that time, but also with some slight uptick in the age of closed debt was due to refinancing to secondary lending platforms, so a combination of factors.                                                                                                  |

This is something that we've kind of touched on as transaction volume. The quote/unquote demand and the extent to which DAI is moving around, why it's moving around is an important question. I've been asked this question from quite a few people. How is the transaction volume of DAI versus the trading volume of DAI?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So a huge peak in June 26th and like roughly July 14, 15 to the tune of like 14 million and 8 and 9 million, but if you look at the total transaction volume on chain that's more to the order of 140 million.

So, even taking those kinds of transfers into account, there's still a fair amount of activity over the past month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We saw with those dips in ETH prices there's a fair amount of liquidations, but again nothing quite record setting. It was just a 30% price drop. But with the way the collateralization ratio has been going, this was something Alex touched on, is that liquidation percentage is hugely driven by what this collateralization ratio graph looks like over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You see the excess supply as has consistently gone down over the past few weeks and the utilization rate, I mean, dYdX is lower, but Compound utilization rate is at like 93%. This makes total sense because to the extent that you can get cheaper DAI on secondary lending platforms there's no reason why people wouldn't do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And so, then when you start to talk about what the rates should be and whether the stability fee should be decreased, et cetera, I think these are really good indicators to look at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Had there been or like is it good for there to be oversupply? There was oversupply. Is it good? Obviously, not. Healthy is complex.

The doctor is going to say you get enough salt in your diet. The excess supply, the oversupply, is going to be high enough to give you like enough of a healthy buffer I think anyways that you don't need to think about like artificially increasing it or anything.

You want some excess on those secondary platforms. But again, I don't think you have to try to increase that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Do you see a scenario where secondary lending platforms basically half the effective DAI supply that would have been if they didn't exist at all? I'm trying to think of the right way to formulate the question because I look at Compound and it's a \$20 million DAI market, right? That's a quarter of the total DAI supply. I don't know. I'm trying to figure out how to correctly ask what I'm trying to think about.

People using those platforms instead of opening CDPs and so forcing Maker into having higher stability fees, which again as you can tell from my description there I don't get how the argument follows, I would say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think it will primarily be purchased DAI that is being supplied, but the borrow volume is fairly significant. It's like 18 million, but as of four days ago it was 11 million. And then, as of seven days ago it was roughly that and it hasn't changed for quite a while. It was 7 million in June 19th. It's kind of been slowly and steadily increasing except for in the last four of five days which is again partly due to UI improvements, partly due to stability fee. But a dYdX borrow volume, for example, has actually gone down a little bit, but [crosstalk 01:08:51].                                                       |

Although those have actually come down fairly significantly, but they're definitely more unpredictable rates. You've seen the utilization come down pretty ... I'm sorry, I'm looking at a graph here at [Sunfair 01:09:55].

I think part of the reason is education in UI, so UI's not to be underestimated. Definitely I think there were some people who were borrowing from dYdX at a higher rate and then realized they could get a lower rate on Compound and decided to switch. That I'm sure is part of the impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And so, I think there were a fair amount of people who'd kind of given up on long positions and probably thus disproportionately affect the borrow on dYdX versus other platforms. Because I think dYdX has it's brand and it's going to be more used more expensive short term plays or at least more unpredictable shorter term plays that probably are for a greater degree of leverage, like going directly 3X or something.                                                                                                                                                                        |

I think it actually probably an economic positive because what was happening with that supply if it wasn't being borrowed on Compound? It's not like people are drawing DAI out now to just go lend it on Compound because that makes no economic sense. If people are that will go down over time as people smarten up, but I don't think that's a reasonable explanation at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If that supply starts to decrease because demand starts to decrease and people want to start using USDC or something else, that's when I think you should be concerned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

I'm not sure that self selection selects for a very stable demand function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

We're just like hyper overreacting in both directions and we're going to get into a crazy loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And then, people are like, "Oh, we have to increase the stability fee again." That's like a weird sort of counter scenario to get into where you create your own demons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And then, it starts to become a really complex psychological equation of had it been increased only to 19% instead of 19.5 would people have been less overreactionary to dropping it to 16.5 creating less of a need to 20.5 or 22 for that matter?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And so, I think the 20.5% increase was even maybe a little bit premature. Definitely now increasing to 22.5 would be premature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's more likely than not then if there is trading volume on DAI for ETH that that would be buying volume. And so, logically, yeah, it's more likely to improve the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Yeah, I mean, obviously as transaction volume increases long term then you have a stronger demand function. That can drive up your supply more sustainably than if you have lower transaction volumes. So yeah, I mean, I think that's a pretty intuitive conclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And so, they will pass. And then, I think if they pass quicker voters will be less likely to react to them or feel the need to react to them and so the system will be stable for that reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
