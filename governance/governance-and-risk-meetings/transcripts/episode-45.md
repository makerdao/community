In these calls we talk about risk, we talk about risk parameters as well. We talk about new collateral types that might be coming in and out of the system. We talk about governance issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

That's my way of pointing out that we're not always going to be talking about risk, the way that we have in the past. And in the next couple weeks we're going to be shifting gears slightly to everybody's favorite topic, which is governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Going to come as no surprise to this group that governance is not a solved problem. MakerDAO, again, is sort of on the leading edge of a lot of issues in the crypto space, one of them is how do we organize lots of people around the world? And how do we organize them when the stakes are high? I guess is an interesting way of putting it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

What those mechanisms look like, what the processes look like, what the debates look like. How signals get surfaced, how they get ratified. These are all important questions that we need to figure out. And we're going to start doing that in earnest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I touched on this briefly in our last call, but when multi collateral DAI launches is depending on two different factors. Basically you can put it into two different buckets. One is the mechanics, the code, the audits, our partners, all these things need to align. So it's what pieces of puzzle we can put in place in the foundation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

When MCD launches is largely dependent on what happens in the forums, what happens in these calls, what happens in various discussions, and what ultimately happens in the voting portal. There's a lot of work that we all need to do together in order to make that happen. Lots of risk analysts, lots of governance fans, if that's even a thing. I guess it is a thing, we can find them all over our forums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And that's a lot of buzz words, and it's a lot of theoretical analogies, but these things are all going to start kicking off in the next week's call, and the week after that we're going to wrap things up. And the week after that we're going to continue to do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And we can start a large conversation, a long tailed conversation about how that impacts the organization, how that impacts governance and how everybody feels about it. There is a lot of things coming up, but that a lot of things coming speech that I just gave is sort of my way of compensating for the fact that I have very little to talk about today. Because there's furious levels of planning and infrastructure work and documentation being written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It's not going to happen today though. So I'm going to jump into my preamble, and then we're going to hand it off to David utrobin, who now has a guest slot on these calls, he's going to give us a recap of what's happening in the forums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Or maybe ... okay it wasn't, it was David's. All right, so it was a great idea. So the reason why this is important is because this is the theme that we've been talking about for months and months and months. But governance decision making does not happen in these calls, it's the venue is far too temporary, the audience is far too small, the language is English, the timezone is North American, and there's all kinds of reasons why this is not the committee where decisions get made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

That's where conversations can surface. That's where deep discussions and manifestos can be posted. And it's turning out to be the case, and I'm very excited about that. The flip side of that is we can't lose sight of what's happening in that forum, and we need to create a bridge between those forum discussions and the discussions we have here. And so David is going to do a recap of what we shouldn't be calling but we are, governance at a glance. Which was an amazing idea that we totally did not steal from LongForWisdom in the forums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

There's seeking consensus, help wanted, ongoing initiatives, and on the horizon. So I'm going to skip over the help wanted because it's kind of peripheral, but just starting with the seeking consensus type threads, there have been a number of them, so the meta is that the community is wanting to use the forums to do some soft consensus before we actually launch into having a robust enough governance polling system to do multiple polls at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And I think most people, not that I think, but in the thread it was a majority vote that this was a good conceptual idea, just to establish consensus through forum polls. But again, there's concerns around that, there's concerns about people that don't hold Maker coming in and affecting this consensus. There's no real verification that you're a Maker holder if you're voting in these, so it's not a perfect solution. But hopefully a better solution will be coming with the 1.5 governance portal soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And then that is the stepping stone to move something into an executive poll. If it actually changes the mechanism of how MakerDAO works, or else if it's more of a principle or a policy type thing then that's enough for it to consider consensus being reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The reason why I find that thing so interesting, that thread so interesting is because it helps us as a group understand the difference between community and governance. I think that governance, Maker token voters who participate in the polling system have a bunch of alignments they need to think about enough, a bunch of incentives, but there's also sort of their responsibility in some ways to act as representatives for the wider community as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And that can inform why there's sentiment, that the Maker token holders can sort of internalize when they come into the voting portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And then afterwards we can answer your questions from the chat or anything like that.

And we saw that there was a 79%, 21% split for a bi-weekly cadence. And so there's ... and that's based on 16 votes, so it's kind of hard to say if there's real consensus, which is still just some issue to keep in mind in regards to the polling. But it seems that people are actually for a bi-weekly cadence. And also Vishesh makes a really great point for it in that if we have a very fast reaction every time something is going on with the peg, it doesn't actually give time for our previous adjustments to have an effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Which we're kind of host to right now. The next signal request seeking consensus thread is regarding, it's called, define a standard stability fee changes based on recent price of DAI. So user Latetot kind of put out a signal request seeing if people would be willing to standardize what the poll should ... or rather, what the executive vote should be based on something like a three day volume weighted average price for DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The open questions that exist that actually make it really hard to do this is the fact that, how do you decide on these parameters? Like, what's the lag time for the effect to kick in? Is it a one day view opposite a three day view, opposite a seven day? And so there was not a lot of strong consensus around that signal request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So the way stability fee polls are right now, it goes in 1% increments up and down, nine different options. The middle option is to keep it. There's four up and four down. And so the exponential rate stepping is just you walk to it. It's like 2%, 4%, 8%. So it gives more flexibility to governance to make more radical changes if they needed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So mostly people are for it, but again, I actually didn't see any serious negative comments against the suggestion except for maybe remove the 8%. Because 8% is like, it's a really big move. And also because if you have 8% that's actually I think two, four, six, eight, yeah it's still nine options, so if you remove the 8% you actually have less options on the poll overall than we currently have. So instead of nine options I think it'll be seven options.

And so at the moment, so user LongForWisdom actually came out and made a suggestion for people to volunteer. And so I think we had 27 total votes in the poll. And of them I think 26 people volunteered to do some level of research for collateral onboarding. Which his great, but Cyrus made it a point that, hold your horses right now because integrations in the internal risk team are actually already doing a lot of the due diligence for these first collateral types. And that in the next week or two they're going to be discussing more about their findings and they're going to just show what they have in regards to some collateral is what I understand.                                                                                                                                      |

Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

One being not concerned at all, 10 is basically the maximum concern they think an emergency shutdown could happen because of this risk or something. Right? And so there's three different risks there currently, so I'm not going to go through them right now, but I encourage you to check it out. And each of the risks is also linked to a discussion thread. So it's not just the poll and a sentence for the risk type, but there's also a place to talk about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So in here I think it was Lix, right? Let me just double check. Yeah, so Licks did a lot of work around calculating the DAI price and he made a point that calculating it from trades actually introduces a lot of noise because of the nature of how trades are made. The fact that removing a limit order from like ETH to DAI takes multiple blocks. And that there's a lot of noise in the signal basically from watching DAI price through Dex Trades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

There's a couple of graphs in the thread that overlays the signals and shows actually the reduction in noise. And also just it's a really really great suggestion, so anybody that's doing DAI price and that kind of stuff, check out that thread because he makes some [inaudible 00:21:36] with his approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And then the last two threads that I'm going to cover in this little recap of what's going on in the forum is the stuff that's on the horizon. So these are threads that are further looking, so they're not immediate concerns, but they're conversations and problems that need to be sorted through. And the main problem right now that's being sorted through is how we create policy around stability fee changes and DSR changes with the coming of multi collateral DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Nobody in governance really thinks of the stability fee right now in terms of the risk premium of the underlying asset, but come multi collateral DAI, and the DSR with it, we're actually going to have an intersection between monetary policy and risk management of all these underlying collaterals and CDP types and CDP packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

But yeah, so the first thread is called, navigating the waters between now single collateral DAI and multi collateral DAI with the DSR. So specifically to this thread, Matthew Rabinowitz talks about what the best step by step process for launching multi collateral DAI would be without disrupting the DAI price. Because if multi collateral DAI launches with some ability for CDP, would be CDP users to mint a lot of excess DAI, we want to be able to control the supply so that it increases gradually if it does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And then the second thread is, is anything wrong with DSR and stability fee calculations as planned for MCD?

So get in early and have your say because there's a lot of interesting things happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Well just to kick it off, state of the peg seems all right at the moment, is the synthesis. So trading volume for the last 24 hours was about 3.8 million DAI for ETH. Earlier it was a little bit higher, a little bit over 4 million, so I think the trading volumes are light but not so small that we should be concerned that price is not actually around $1. But yeah, it's trading at like very very slightly over $1. And in the previous 24 hours was trading very very slightly below \$1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So you can see over time previously we were hovering between 98, 99. Had a little bit of a rough period at the beginning of July, dipping down to 97 some a couple of times. And then basically slowly but surely after this 18.5% increase there is a bit of a recovery period where that price was consistently increasing. And has now settled around basically literally at \$1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

As you can see some of the driver as that as well, right, and this is something that I say at this point pretty much every week. But stability fee doesn't determine that DAI price, right? If it did then it would have immediately gone up to $1 at 20.5, or even previously at 19.5, it would have just sat at $1. So clearly there's more going on then just the stability fee. And so that's another thing that I wanted to touch on here is we've now entered a little bit of periodicity with what's been going on with DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So stability fee's increasing, DAI price is still low. DAI price comes up and then comes down a bit. Stability fee is lowered, DAI price stays relatively steady for a while and then suddenly dips. Stability fee is increased, DAI price stays relatively steady. Stability fees further increased, and DAI price holds for a moment and then continues to rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

But if you start to use it as a multivariate calc with what's going on with ETH price it does start to make a little bit more sense. So at this 20.5% stability fee another thing was going on right at the same time, which was this ETH price was coming down pretty significantly. And pretty suddenly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

During the decrease there's not necessarily a recovery in DAI. But post this decrease, if the ETH price is just holding steady, then if multiple people are not levering back up on the ETH because they were already levered up, so the ETH price had risen in the June time period. People were levering up during that time, it held steady at the turn of the month, and people had not cashed out during that time. So what's interesting is had ETH's price risen further, potentially people would have cashed out and the leverage would have gone down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So these behaviors actually are what drive the DAI price more than anything. And the stability fee changes the sensitivity to those behaviors. So right now what you have effectively is a higher stability fee and the secondary lending picture fills in some of this gap of why this doesn't visually make sense if you just look at it. But yeah the DAI price has been recovering though ETH price took a big hit.

I think some of those analyses took a back burner to some of the other collateral risk stuff, but definitely it is possible. When I initially ran the numbers I found a very high ... it's not the same as a confidence interval. But basically a fairly reliable R-squared value when looking at the relationship between ETH and DAI price using stability fee as a modifier. So something in the 60, 70% range, which is pretty good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So if you want to directly measure, you want to directly measure leveraging behavior, and that would give you the most direct explanation. The problem is, that there's not a very good variable you can point to that says this is leveraging behavior. There are proxies for it. You can look at some of the ETH/USD long shorts. You can look at some of the purchasing and selling behavior on Unistop or something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

What I find is looking at some of those proxies is decent in terms of explaining what's doing on with DAI price. But a more holistic view of actually looking at this graph and actually breaking down, okay when was there a run up? When was DAI price depressed? What were the trading volumes during these times? And actually physically looking at these graphs I find to be the most effective strategy for understanding what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Like long and short behavior was something that we had looked at in the past. But even ETH and DAI, so this is where I had a long time ago spoken about this ratio between the short and longterm prices. That effectively is a similar proxy, right? So if you were to look at a second derivative of the ETH price compared to its long run average, effectively what you're saying is, when was it decreasing? When was it increasing? And what you're looking for is a time period where it was decreasing and then increasing, and whether DAI price was affected during that time period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And then after that dip DAI went up, that you can reasonably guess that is an instance of people levering up and selling DAI and then cashing out and purchasing DAI back to pay down their debts. So looking for those kinds of patterns I think is the most reliable strategy for explaining drivers for DAI price. But even just visually looking at these things it seems to be pretty clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So what's really interesting about DAI lately is there's a lot of debate around, is this caused by the stability fee, or would it have happened otherwise under a lower stability fee? Now the thing is with the ETH price going down significantly, what you have is effectively a bunch of stressed leveraged positions, right? So a lot of traders who levered up on ETH using DAI, and now have to either re-liquidate it, or have to make a hard decision of holding onto that position and paying increasingly higher interest rates, not just on Maker, but now with the change in how Compound is calculating their interest rates, or the removal of the Cap effectively.                                                                                                                                                                |

So really now you actually do have a lot more exposure to the stability fee, or at least the stability fee with a slight discount than you did before. So that really does kind of bone on bone is a concept that I've discussed before. You have less of a buffer for demand, and now people are actually starting to feel some of that pain they feel. And that tends to put a premium on DAI and drive the price up a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You can see here, and what I find fascinating is you start to see some of this periodicity in these repeated patterns. And you see a repeated pattern under an extremely different rate. So if you look back to February/March very very low stability fees. The DAI supply was running up fairly significantly all the way up to 95 million. Now March 18th around that same time period ... I'll just zoom out here a little.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So lower than what was deemed acceptable at the time, and I think lower than what we would currently deem acceptable. The big difference is not really ... but 97 cents vs. 98 is not a huge difference. So the big difference I think is in the variability of DAI price. And so I want to show volatility here, but it's effectively the volatility of DAI is decreased significantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The supply was higher, oversupply was obviously higher. But in nominal price in supply terms it wasn't a significant difference, right? So if I run this back through an analysis script it wouldn't produce hugely different values, but when you plug in that ... and this is what Licks is alluding to is noise in the prices vs. order books. But the noise in the prices is actually also an important data point to capture, right? Because those prices that those trades are getting executed at is effectively what people had to do during that time period because more often than not I think when people are trading DAI they have a very high time preference for getting access to that DAI, or selling that DAI to get access to leverage to take advantage of a particular price. |

At least when it comes to dealing with CDPs. So I think the numbers look similar, but things were actually very different at the time. Then you have sort of DAI supply running down in May, and the stability fee getting significantly increased in April/May. And then DAI supply bottoming out here around 80 million. Drops of the stability fee, and at the same time ETH price running up. And then DAI supply is running up with significant amount of leveraging behavior, but at a higher stability fee. So actually comparatively a fairly stable DAI price, right? 98, 99 cents on the dollar is not that bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And part of that is just a different level of confidence in the ability to arbitrage DAI. And I think that's psychological effect is not to be discounted, but also I think less oversupply and so at this point in time 85 million vs. before meant two very different things is effectively the answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And the most recent it's back up to 79 million. But you saw 5 million DAI getting wiped in a day and then 2 million, then 3 million. There's repetitive behavior burning millions of DAI each day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

But also the excess supply on the secondary lending platforms had dried up pretty significantly which we'll touch on. This is legitimately just a destruction of oversupply. And so now I think there are very thin margins and I think at this point likely that someone could come in and make the argument that this has actually been a dip in demand potentially due to just stress on what's been going on with ETH, or even due to a 20.5% stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

But this is strong caution I think against increasing the stability fee further. At least just in terms of what he data is indicating. And I think the circulation of debt tends to back this claim up quite a bit. So what you saw was essentially open debt had significantly decreased in age. And closed debt has actually increased in age a bit. So to overtake the age of open debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think that's a good thing to look out for effectively. On a standalone I think the repayment of old debt is more often a good metric than bad metric. And it speaks to circulation, which I think is good for the system. It keeps unrealized fees lower, which is obviously a mathematical benefit to Maker holders. And I think it decreases the amount of risk and keeps efficiency up effectively. Economic efficiency up in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So just to quickly explain the open debt age decreased. This kind of ties into more of the debt that's being drawn out, is being drawn out from pre-existing CDP's. And less new open debt has been created recently, but more old debt has been closed out. And so that makes total sense when you consider that the DAI supply has come down from 90 million 12 days ago to 78, 79 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I mean there was similar degree of drops in the end of 2018, and in August when there was seen a lot of new stuff being released. So this is touching on collateralization.

So this is actually perfectly opposite reaction to the ETH price right around here. So people were scared, there were liquidations, and a significant amount of ETH was being locked on a daily basis, and then what's interesting is just in the last few days with the significant decrease in DAI supply there is a fairly significant decrease in locked collateral.

So effectively, if CDP's have no debt then for most calculation they're counted out. In terms of the total pool of collateral, those are still included, but I've graphed this before. Those are pretty tail, like pretty edge case, I think. I don't think ETH locked with no debt makes up a significant portion of the ETH supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So I don't want everyone to just hear, oh DAI supply dropped by 10 million, everything's going to hell in a hand basket. Because it's not that simple. It's a severe destruction of oversupply. There may be some slight decrease in demand, it would be stupid to totally exclude that scenario, but that wouldn't be the whole picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And it has come close in the past and there's always this spread, dYdX fluctuates above and below. Compound basically keeps the spread below. That spread was sitting for a while earlier in July. But in the past week or so has come up very close. And that's pretty easily explicable with the utilization here, so dYdX utilization, like is said, for other reasons fluctuates a little bit more and stays a little bit lower. Because I think dYdX is kind of nestled into this use case of being a little bit more shorter term loans and a little bit more derivative highly leveraged plays.                                                                                                                                                                  |

So effectively like when people want to source DAI at a slight discount they'll source it from Compound instead of Maker. If people just want to supply DAI currently, since there's no DSR at the moment, they'll just go do that on Compound. So that's kind of where that's sitting right now, but the utilization rate has shot up in the past month and now is hovering around 98% which is pretty crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And the borrow volume is just it exploded in May, was kind of quiet in June, and then has shot up again in July. And no small part of this is attributable to, or you can attribute a decent portion of this to what's been going on with Instadapp, the changes in the Compound rates, and I think just a lot of it don't underestimate UI and awareness branding, marketing, things like that are very powerful as well. So I think just a better awareness of the fact that you can get the same DAI at a cheaper rate has reduced the excess supply that's available in these platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And actually [inaudible 00:51:31] just dYdX and Compound it's not counting in like Dharma, Nuo or anything like that. So that's fairly significant. It's I don't think something to be worried about per se, right? So I think there should be this narrative of like oh what happens on dYdX and Compound is taking market share away from Maker, is not necessarily true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So this has basically been like 7-10 million DAI at times. It's just sitting there not being used by anyone, and so that sum, if you look at July 7th, that was around five and 2.5, like 7.5 million. It's come down by about 5 million. So at least what you can effectively think of as pigeon hole principle, what goes in and what comes out, about 5 million of that excess supply has come down. And so at least half of the decrease in DAI supply could reasonably be explained by an increased amount of usage on secondary lending platforms. And so that's literally just an arbitrage of people getting a cheaper rate and saving themselves a couple of points.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So as that opportunity decreases in size, the profitability of that opportunity decreases. And so I think that explains a decent portion of what's been going on with the decrease in supply. I don't think anybody should make the case that it's even, I think mostly, been a decrease in demand. I think it has mostly been an improvement in efficiency, but at the same time, now we're very very close to the margin. I would seriously take this as a data point to keep the stability fee as is, or even potentially decrease it slightly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I would caution against this sort of ping ponging behavior and overshooting in both directions. Which I think has caused some problems in my honest estimation. So going from 19.5% suddenly down to 17.5% and then again further suddenly down to 16.5% was an over reaction I think.

So I would not be surprised if a lot of people start to come out as this DAI price increases and say, hey drop the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Yeah, so 18.5%, again, I mean that's hopping it back to where it was July 9th, so there's actually a logical reason for doing that. I would have probably suggested a smaller decrease. And so this I think speaks to the exponential voting polls. I think having small infrequent changes is most of the time going to be easier to manage for the system.

It's the fact that with this decrease if it passes, it actually is going to I guess ... I don't know if it's going to make it even more narrow, or even potentially beat the borrow rate on Compound. But do you see the parity of the rates between something like Compound or secondary lending markets in general with Maker to be like a significant point of data?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

DAI is inherently asymmetric, and I will say that over and over and over again. So similar to how when you arbitrage DAI above $1 it's a quick and easy thing, when you arbitrage DAI below $1 you have to potentially sit with it until it returns to peg and take on a bit of risk and a bit of time and cost to capital. Similarly, when it comes to lending, if you drop the stability fee to below the Compound borrow rate you will immediately incentivize refinancing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The problem is, doing it in the reverse direction, when the stability fee is higher having that bridge and refinancing to Compound, for example, has not always been as quick I think of a reaction as you would see in that scenario. I think people would be quicker to refinance back to Maker because the stability fee is a slightly more predictable rate I think than like Compound rates for example, or dYdX rates for that matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It takes a little bit more time I think for people to refinance to something like Compound. So again, inherent asymmetries in DAI, and I think you got to be weary of those. Similar asymmetries I think when decreasing the stability fee is not equivalent to increasing a stability fee. And you have to take into account very different concerns and you have to I think be much more careful about decreasing the stability fee than you do about increasing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And so similarly, I think when you're thinking about these secondary lending rates you have to think much more carefully about decreasing the borrow rate of DAI to less than what is currently available on other platforms than you do increasing it to a rate that is higher than what's available on other platforms. Because when you increase it to a rate that's higher than what's available on other platforms, people can just eat into excess supply and there's relatively little increased risk for the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Potentially making it cheaper, and potentially putting more DAI back on the market, which could potentially decrease the DAI price. So it could ironically have a much stronger effect than an increase in the stability fee would have on improving the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And so, 18.5, we'll see what happens. But small even half a percent changes at a time I think make a ton of sense. And making them slower than inter week and definitely seven days I think makes sense.

Do we have to see a change in the profile of what DAI has demanded for to see like rates drop, lets say like if we wanted to see an equilibrium come about naturally of let's say a 10% stability fee on DAI. Like in single collateral, because this might change conceptually in multi collateral. But yeah, you get my question. Kind of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So I'm just going to restate in my own words what I think is effectively when do you consider actual data driven scientific signals for decreasing the stability fee? And I think one, you watch that excess supply and you watch the utilization rates on the secondary lending platforms. Especially in the absence of the DSR. So to what extent is there excess DAI supply floating out around there? And to what extent can that shield the demand curve from the stability fee being potentially too high?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [#](#010128) / [01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h01m28s) | Vishesh Choudhry | So theoretically if you're going to lower the stability fee, it's because you're saying it's too high. You should just lower the stability fee to try to get it as low as possible. You should lower it because you think it is too high. And those are I think an important distinction that seems very subtle, that I think gets lost. But the nuance is important. So there is an equilibrium that theoretically exists, you want to manage to that equilibrium so that you're balancing DAI price, you're balancing cost of using the system, you're balancing holistic system level metrics, and level of risk in the system so that if ETH makes a crazy movement tomorrow the whole system isn't screwed.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [#](#010209) / [01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h02m09s) | Vishesh Choudhry | And so like your balancing all these things at the same time, and that is the equilibrium point that you're trying to manage. The problem is we have low visibility on the equilibrium point, and so you use the stability fee as this very indirect gain knob to try and navigate to that equilibrium point. And so when you're trying to decrease the stability fee it should be because you think it is too high. And so then what does it mean when you think a stability fee is too high?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I won't say price because this isn't the same economic question. But effectively if that excess supply is not present or is significantly decreasing, now you run into the risk of hampering the demand curve. And so I think excess supply is effectively what you're trying to manage towards with that stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

But if everything was totally steady, if the DAI price was precisely at \$1 and excess supply was not moving an inch, borrow volumes on secondary lending platforms were not moving an inch, then you might say, yes we're at an equilibrium point. And there's nothing at this moment that justifies making any change to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So right now we see that Compound utilization is super high, excess supply as seen on dYdX and Compound has dropped. But you think that this is kind of at the margin because we didn't see a premium in the DAI price, right? You think we're at like a very delicate ... do you think we're at a very delicate equilibrium point right now because we don't see a premium in the DAI price? Despite the fact that this excess supply has dropped significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And so if there was ... right, so this is what I was talking about is the volume is mid to low range in the 3-4 million range. Had it been 14 million yesterday, then you would have seen a huge run up in DAI price. Had a bunch of people decided to lever up at whatever 222 ETH price currently, had you seen a bunch of people decide to lever up at that price then you would have seen DAI price depress significantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And this is I think the really hard thing for people to get away from is just looking at the DAI price as being the be all and end all. When that excess supply has soaked up fairly significantly, I think now as long as DAI price is in a relatively good place, right? So if DAI price had been 96 cents on the dollar than what you're basically going to say is, I don't care what the demand function is, I need to soak up oversupply today so that DAI doesn't go into some kind of spiral scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And that's what you really try and change is the ratio of what is buying activi ... the percentage of buying activity vs. selling activity on DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The reason that I'm saying I see a case for holding the stability fee or dropping it very very slightly is because that excess supply has soaked up significantly because DAI supply overall has come down significantly.

So it's not like a extremely stressful scenario where ... and the thing that I'm cautioning against being extremely worried about is this decrease in DAI supply. So I could hear people thoughts effectively when I saw that DAI supply go down. And I'm sure there were plenty of people who were concerned that okay Maker is losing usership to things like Compound and dYdX. And I'm sure that's the narrative that ran through some people's heads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So it's not impossible to think, but I think it would be primarily due to ETH price not due to stability fee. That there was some decrease demand for leverage. And so there may have been a slight decrease in demand, that's totally possible. But that 10 million was not a 10 million drop in demand. It was at least [crosstalk 01:09:02].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And I brought it up a couple times on chat, but I'm actually really interested to get Vishesh's point of view on it. Which is that, Compound did not uncap their rates, what they did was they moved ... or maybe it's changed since then, I could be wrong, but within the past week their change was to move the Cap, still at 100% utilization, the borrow would be 20%. And what I have been thinking about is that actually creates a race condition between in any kind of a scenario where the stability fee on Maker is above the total possible cap on Compound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And that, in that exact scenario lenders cannot take out any money. And I worry that this could create some kind of a feedback loop in a 0% oversupply scenario that there is actually still no reason for anyone who has lend out on ... or for borrow out on Compound to take it out. But then none of the lenders can actually take out to rebalance the system where they actually hold a third of the DAI on the market where people may need to close out their positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And so it is a very short window of time, but then market Makers react by generating a lot of DAI to push that back out.

And that's moved up from 17 and could move in the future too, but that-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And it's a good distinction, I kind of over simplified it in my explanation. It's not a removal of the cap, it's just a moving of the cap. But I think the effect is ultimately the same. So if the cap is moved from 17 to 20, I don't think the fee would not be extremely likely on Compound to hit that exactly 20 cap. Even in the current scenario. I think I am more worried about the Compound, or dYdX for that matter, rate being cheaper ... or sorry being more expensive than the Maker rate because that's an immediate effect of increasing the supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And so I think has some potential concerns, especially for the peg specifically. But I think especially with the absence of the DSR currently, Maker has benefited from Compound and dYdX having more often than not a cheaper route for obtaining DAI. And so this is where I kind of go back to if the stability fee is too high, and this was a big criticism while the stability fee was being raised three, five, seven, 11, 14, et cetera. People were worried about the demand function. And the likelihood for the stability fee to actually decrease the demand for DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Because that actually helps to protect the demand function from a stability fee that is potentially overshot. And so I think it's actually in Maker's best interest for Compound and dYdX to have a cheaper rate. So I'm not worried about that scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And that immediately throws us back into a 2018 scenario where there's some kind of screwed up incentives and potentially some adverse effects on DAI's function. And it's very hard to unwind those as we've seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When we get back into the way things were, I think it was end of 2018, if the stability fee is smaller than the borrow rate on these platforms then it's cheaper to mint DAI than it is to borrow it from the secondary lending platforms.

What I was saying was effectively it may happen, yes. But first I think what would happen is people would source DAI from Maker, that would drive up supply, DAI would get flooded onto the market. Some of that would potentially get supply to these platforms. Borrow volume may decrease on some of these platforms. And then that propagates into their systems and then those rates get adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And when it goes onto the market DAI price takes a hit, people freak out, stability fee gets raised. I mean this is exactly what happened. But even if the borrow rate is cheaper on Maker, I'm saying there are some potential concerns to think about where I think you do have a short term effect of DAI ... like yes those rates would get arb'd, but in the process DAI I think would make it onto the market and the peg would potentially take a hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So if the supply goes up and people do not refinance from secondary lending platforms, then yes. But if people start to decrease the amount they're borrowing on secondary lending platforms, and then go ahead and increase the DAI supply, you're basically just returning a portion of the oversupply and flooding some DAI onto the market in the process. I don't see how that's a positive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I think it's actually been helpful for Maker. And I think this makes sense, right? So if you start to think about dYdX as a short term more expensive highly levered platform for primarily derivative plays. If you start to think about Maker as the last resort for minting DAI supply when there's not enough floating out there in the market. And you start to think about Compound as this middle ground of a slightly cheaper place to borrow DAI, and a place where you can lock up some DAI to get this pseudo DSR effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I know that if a lot of people have a lot of text, like almost nobody's going to read it except for those people that already are commenting and giving their rationale. But, for newcomers it gives them kind of like an Amazon's rating page where they could go and make their own decision. Like oh okay, this person is doing it for this reason. It gives people the ability to think for themselves, so I think it's probably positive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

But I'm going to push back on the reason alone. So I think there's been a problem in Maker governance which is a bit of a disconnect between what the conversation is and what the votes end up being. And I think in order to have effective governance you need to resolve that gap. Or the community needs to resolve that gap. That would be my inclination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Or at least then it begs the question of are you appropriately devoting your time and resources? And so I think there's a tremendous lack of visibility into the thought processes and rationales of a fairly decent chunk of the voters. I don't often hear ... I hear myself talk, I hear people on these governance calls talk. I hear a lot of great posts on the forums and the chats, but rarely do they tend to be making the same case as what the polls and the votes end up being.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So it's like this is how you going to go about doing this. What I'm more talking about is, it may not necessarily be writing it out because I think that's high overhead and you're not likely to force people to write out what they're thinking. But there has to be a way at some point I think to understanding why people are voting the way they are. It doesn't necessarily have to be writing it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I think I guess what I'm thinking is like I would like to post it to the forum because I do feel like there's no current coordinated place to talk about what you're voting or why you voted. And so I guess I'm looking in one sense I'm looking like should be do the discussion afterwards? Which is like, I don't say anything before, but afterwards I say, hey I voted 19.5, here's my reasons, blah blah blah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

With like it helps me crystallize my reasoning. But I do think that for instance part of the reason that I think this is important is that I'm pretty sure there is some 14,000 Maker holder that is constantly voting on the rates, but is not reading ... either not reading chat regularly, or not reading chat at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So I'm just going to start doing it there and we'll see. If other people want to do something different, but like the chat is definitely the wrong place and it's too ephemeral.

But here we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
