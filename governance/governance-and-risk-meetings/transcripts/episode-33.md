Welcome to the May 2nd edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting with Maker Dao. We have a surprisingly relaxed, I'm predicting call today because I think we've reached a point in the governance process and our manipulating of the risk parameters where it might be time to have sort of a more of a free flowing chat in this call, more of a focus on Q&A and less on interesting and or dramatic recent events so I'm not going to do much speechifying today. I will do the same reminder I do every single time, I will never stop and nobody can make me stop. We are very, very interested in getting feedback from the people on this call so lots of smart people, lots of strong opinions, lots of analysis in people's back pockets. We want to see as much of that as possible so even if we're speechifying and rambling and looking at graphs, if you come up with questions or you have comments or there's things that you want to say, please do not be shy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If they don't, type it again, because we might have missed it, things can get hectic in here. If you have access to a microphone, jump on it and start talking. Don't wait for an opening if you don't want to, though it would be nice if you let people finish their sentences before you jump in with a rebuttal. We're also super keen about continuing this discussion. This is a very tiny window of opportunity for people to engage with the governance process. It's not designed to be the place where decisions are made or governance happens. This is where we talk about major themes and come up with plans and debate them in other areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This is a link to our subreddit, the r/mkrgov subreddit. There's a post there that right now is advertising the meeting after the meeting's over that turns into the discussion thread for the meeting so if you have a question, I would also dearly love it if you would paste those questions into the subreddit because that lives on for a week or more, and it gives us plenty of opportunity for people to respond and provide input. The chat here, we only have about 15 minutes to get somebody's interest, so Reddit is better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I always forget something and then I halfway remember then I cut Steven up and maybe I won't do it this time so Steven, I'm going to hand this off to you for your thoughts of the week and then we'll talk risk and then I'll talk a bit about the poll so Steven Sawyer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Firstly, hello again, everyone and welcome. Really appreciate you taking your time and obviously committing resources towards exploring and facing these challenges of scientific governance as community. It's quite impressive to see the number of folks that turnout week after week. We can take on these challenges for the system as a whole but the one thing that I'd like to bring up and in light of recent events is just to recap quickly on some of the strengths and weaknesses of a decentralized stablecoin and I'm going to start off with what is always seen as an apparent weakness and that is a decentralized stablecoin seems to be at the foibles of the underlying DeFi environment, the underlying ecosystem and is always representative of what that system looks like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Everybody understands where the supply is coming from. Everyone has the ability to see and analyze where the supply is going to. The stakeholders to the system are transparent. The very idea of a decentralized stablecoin being transparent is firstly, its weakness because all the risks are exposed but at the same time, that's where its strength is. There's nothing opaque. There's nothing left outside of the users view. Everybody can see very clearly what is involved in the system, what the supply is of the system and the effects of it, and this is really where we can get to a forum like this and discuss clearly the underlying dynamics behind those risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

On that point, looking at some of the wins we've had, there's obviously a lot of debates around the use of certain levers in trying to restore the peg. To that point, the idea is also, what does it mean to restore the peg? What does successes look like? We've used the stability fee and to my mind, and I'm just a single data point in this, I feel that progress has been made. We are getting to a point. Now the argument could be made that maybe it wasn't the stability fee, maybe it's the onsets of a range bound ETH collateral that is contributing towards the restoration. Well, I don't know.

A lot of folks have asked me, do you think the peg is broken? I think, well, no, it's not. It actually is kind of stable. It's just not at the value that we intended so I don't mean to make it farcical but the idea is that the stability of the value is there, it's just generally at a discount and that discount is more reflective of the regime that we're in and what I foresee is that as soon as Multi Collateral DAI comes out and as soon as we start getting the right kind of collateral into that portfolio, and then the next caveat is that the portfolio gets to a certain critical mass, we will find the diversification effect working on our behalf, making the collateral portfolio stable and that stability gets transferred into the price of DAI and also and interestingly enough, the volatility of the stability fee as well and with the hope that the stability fee comes down and represents accordingly a more competitive rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Again, keep in mind that decentralized scientific governance ultimately is considered and facilitated by the foundation in this hour, in order to help MKR governance make decisions, that is really important and at the same time, this is a continuous function so please be involved as much as possible. That's me on the back of that.

That was a great reminder. I'm going to try and keep my segment small or as lightweight as possible today so I'm not going to get into some big speeches. I am going to do something that I find is useful in a quickly evolving space that like the one that we're in right now and that is to point out some of the obvious things that we've been discovering in the last few calls. Crypto space, one year in crypto is five years in the normal world. We're constantly looking ahead and trying to predict what the world will look like and we're always wrong. We're more often looking six months back and trying to figure out what happened and that's fine I think, but it's important that everybody or the community as a whole sort of gathers around these paradigms that are reflective about what actually did happen and I think that we're kind of in that process right now at MakerDAO or at least I am. Maybe I'm just slower on the uptake than a lot of people in this room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We assume these things were true in the past. I think that now we're reaching a stage whether unarguably the case and one of those things is shaped or sort of falls into this bucket of product market fit. That's often used term in this space and I think that one of the things that we've discovered over the course of the last year since we launched is that MakerDAO has found a product market fit, found a great one. The market loves it. The interesting thing is that in these situations, the market determines what that fit is, that we don't determine what the fit is. Over the course of the last year, we've become certain, I'm using the word we here and obviously open to being debated on this product, on this topic, but CDPs are a tool for people that are seeking leverage. It's as simple as that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The system has to follow the behavior of its users and that behavior is leverage and so we're in a world where the fees associated to incentivize or disincentivize that behavior need to mimic the fees that are already very well understood in the space, our space in the traditional finance world of what kind of premium you attach to that risk that people are willing to take on and I think that that sort of brings the stability fee process that we're in right now searching for that equilibrium into crystal clarity. It's just simply the world we're living in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I want to talk very quickly about the results of the poll, because I tend to forget to do that and that's the whole reason we're here and one of the reasons we're here, but we're seeing this interesting trend over the course of the last two poll and governance polls where there's no longer a clear rush to one extreme or the other. People aren't overwhelmingly voting for the 4% option. We're seeing the rise of a moderate faction possibly or a trend in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It was the week before, okay, we saw this sort of a deviation or a neck and neck race between 2% and 3% and we saw the same thing again this week, which I think is a very interesting trend so we had a photo finish between the 2% and 3% raise options. 3% won out, 32K staked as opposed to 27K staked at 2% so on Friday, we'll have an executive vote for a 3% raise to the stability to bring us to what I believe is 19.5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think today after we hear from Vishesh with the state of the peg, I think we're just going to open it up to just general conversation. I think we have a few topics lined up that could be interesting to discuss, such as how to determine when the peg has been fixed, what kind of indicators are we looking for? It seems like right now, we're at least headed in the right direction so it might be a good time to start thinking about these kinds of things and I think we might hear from Matthew as well, with some of his concerns, thoughts on that as well but yeah, in general, I think it's just going to be somewhat of an open ended conversation and yeah, so Vishesh if you're ready.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I had a couple of things to show this week. I did kind of want to add a little bit of context this time so I think there's been a lot of discussion about what are the use cases for CDPs, what are the right use cases for CDPs, and how is that affecting the DAI price?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I think there's a spectrum effectively of sort of bullishness and bearishness in the sense of primarily on ETH price right now, because that's the big collateral type but essentially, as people are more bullish, they're seeking leverage and so they're drawing more debt out of CDPs and then when people are more bearish, they would potentially buy up Dai, as a shelter or just really look to delever their positions as they get less bullish on these and so I think like that underlying bullish/bearishness behavior is what's driving a lot of what's going on and I think we'll try to add more insights kind of week over week to better illuminate how that's going so we can fine tune what needs to happen or doesn't need to happen with the stability fee on kind of a week over week cadence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I know there's been some kind of natural rollercoaster behavior up and down in between and I think Lev's chart in terms of the dot plot shows this a little bit better but essentially, even though on average, the prices actually held relatively steady in the sort of 97 to 98 range over the past couple weeks, there were a few spikes, stuff that was going on with Tether, things like that but those tend to stabilize, I think and so what we've really seen is that as we've increased the stability fee over the past few weeks, I think the DAI price has actually stabilized a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This is still the relationship between DAI and ETH price, holds at least visually fairly strong so I think this kind of speaks to the importance again of just the degree of bullish and bearish sentiment on ETH being a big driver for the sort of fluctuations in DAI price although it is a good sign that even though this did kind of ramp up a bit and ramp back down, the magnitude I think of those fluctuations and their impact on DAI price has gone down and I think that's what we'll tend to see as DAI supply decreases, particularly as oversupply decreases. I think just the degree of variation and as we increase the stability fee, which I'll talk about in a second, I think we'll see the degree of fluctuation in DAI price based on what's going on with ETH price decrease and so it may not actually necessarily come all the way back up to one but I think a little bit more stability, even if it is a little bit below \$1 peg is a positive indicator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We've seen some big kind of wipes and burns, but not necessarily a bunch of big new CDP positions that have been taken out so I think this is just again an indicator that what we're doing has a legitimate impact on the DAI supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In terms of what's been going on with Compound, I think all quiet on the western front there. Things have been relatively stable, even with the increase in the stability fee on the 28th so I mean there's a slight increase which is to be expected but it is interesting that the Maker stability fee has been able to keep its lead on the Compound rate. I think, and then if we go to volume for a sec, that has also held relatively stable so I think again, what this says is that places like Compound are falling into a more natural sort of secondary lending position in relation to Maker, which I think has not been the case in the past. In the past, there's been either some arbitrage opportunity or people pulling DAI out just to lend it but now. I think we're starting to see more of the use case of people will actually look to Compound or Dharma or things like that as an alternative to drawing DAI from CDPs as opposed to in the past where it's been super cheap to draw from CDPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I know there's a lot of discussions that have been going on in terms of how much do these secondary lending platforms contribute to demand versus just kind of being an alternative pathway but still having the same ultimate effect on supply and demand for Dai, and I'm sure plenty of people will have extensive discussion about that. In terms of just numerically what's been going on, I do kind of want to skip over a little bit to something else that I've been putting together. Apologies, it's not in the website just yet but I had kind of pulled the data and gotten a chance to graph it just before the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I think what this means is that what we've been doing with the stability fee has reduced the overall profitability of going hyper levered and so what we've seen is people actually kind of delevering their positions a little bit. I think we've also seen a little bit more stability in what's been going on with ETH price and so people have kind of both from less of a desire for levering up, although that's very hard to measure from a data perspective in terms of how much people are actually levering up, what you can measure is kind of a theoretical leverage based on the collateralization ratios and I'll show that in just a second but in terms of the actual amount of leverage that people are getting, it's hard to track but my suspicion is this is a result of a decreased appetite for leverage, and I will show the calculations on that in just a second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I think the circulation of debt in the system is an important metric because large quantities of unpaid fees are a systemic risk, I believe and so one of the topics that I think is worthy of bringing up on a call like this is kind of what's going to happen in the Single Collateral to Multi Collateral shutdown. From my understanding, the current state is that unpaid fees would not get, they would essentially be forgiven on shutdown and switch over from an SCD to MCD. Now, right now, the governance process has the optionality of instituting a tax or a penalty on any outstanding debt and fees at the time of the switchover and I think it's going to be really important for us to kind of lock that down because in the absence of that, the incentives are just kind of screwy, where people could sit with a bunch of outstanding debt and not have to worry about it and I think there was some tweet about some large holders that were kind of thinking this way and so I just want to make sure that that's a topic that this group kind of nails down soon and there was some chat on the Rocket chat about this as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Do we have confirmation of that? Because obviously, if that's true, then we could explain why certain CDP people just weren't running their CDPs when we were increasing the stability fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I don't think, I think that that's not the right framing because one, there is a tax as Vishesh mentioned, to penalize those CDPs and two, I just don't think that-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I don't want to sort of create any unnecessary doubt or uncertainty but essentially, there is a specification for a tax that exists in the governance framework as I understand it. I just was bringing up, I think it's important to lock that down, figure out what that's going to be and make sure that gets implemented. I don't think it's a super likely scenario or rational behavior that people are expecting that a tax does not get implemented but just, you never know what people are thinking and it's very hard to quantify that so I think just from a good housekeeping and communication perspective, it would probably be a good idea to lock those down and communicate them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think that it would be extremely risky to count on this as some kind of secret backdoor to avoid fees when we switch over to the new system. There will be additional details coming up but people are still writing contracts at this point so we don't have anything we can publish right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Yeah, I'll just wrap up and I'm sure people want to discuss some of these topics so just to that point, I was looking at how old the debt is and how much it's been circulating through the system. I'm pleased to report that since the sort of increases, I would say significantly starting in March, you did kind of see but a little bit earlier on in February as well, you did start to see the trend kind of reversing itself so this is just the shorter snapshot of February to now but if I expanded the scale, you would essentially see that the age of the debt here has been increasing over time but since around February, March, that trend has kind of started to reverse itself where the open debt is not as old anymore and what we've seen is the age of the debt that is being bitten or voluntarily closed out has been increasing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Now the last thing I just wanted to briefly mention, and I'm happy to share any of this stuff for anyone to poke holes at later, essentially I did some rough calculations on kind of how bullish you have to be on ETH for it to be profitable for you to just go max levered or levered up to a recent, like whatever the latest collateralization ratio was so essentially, if people are familiar with the leverage calculation, I'll skip over this part but essentially, given a certain collateralization ratio, there's a maximum threshold of leverage you can reach and the theoretical maximum leverage point is 300%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Essentially, the point was when I looked into this, I saw that you don't have to be that bullish on ETH for it to be profitable for you to just go levered up, ignore the stability fees and hold on for dear life. I think what this means is based on how high, the stability fee is not actually that high. It's effectively I think a point, so based on what the stability has been in the past in particular, but even still now, I think there's an equilibrium that exists and the fulcrum point is a function of the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

That's across all CDPs but do you have any metrics that are like CDPs that have an outstanding debt of let's say, greater than $100,000, folks that are actually actively levering, not folks that have $5 outstanding in a CDP, because that's going to screw with the metrics if you include 500 folks that actually don't have really any money and don't care if it gets bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Because I mean, kind of to your point, the folks that have lots and lots of DAI outstanding, they're using it as you're more than likely related to leverage transactions so the question I'm trying to get at is the ones that have the many, let's say greater than $100,000 are ones that are probably active in that type of space, folks that have a CDP of less, it helps us bring granularity and focus into folks to identify the sensitivity to where a given CDP owner decides this is just too expensive, I need to back down, where some folks if you have it blended across all of them, the guys who've got a $2, excuse me 2 DAI outstanding, at some point, they just don't even care if it gets bitten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In terms of the stats that I've shown here, like for example, the collateralization ratio is sort of total debt weighted across the whole system, but I could look at the collateralization ratios of the larger CDPs and then calculate the max leverage for those CDPs and then what we can essentially assume and I think it's not unreasonable is that people who are taking out big CDP positions are probably pursuing close to what their maximum leverage is given their actual collateralization ratios and so I think it is not unreasonable to say hey, whatever the max leverage is for those large CDPs is probably close to the leverage that they're actually pursuing and so we could look at that as an update to this is kind of segmented out for those larger CDPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

One was current debt, the age of current debt outstanding in a system and the other one was closed debt. Is that right? Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

CDPs, in particular debt tranches, so I had to do this at the individual kind of draw level. DAI that is outstanding, how old is that DAI is the blue line. The red line is essentially DAI that has been bitten or wiped that was created so essentially, for a particular date, essentially DAI that was created before that date and was closed by that date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Are you doing FIFO or LIFO? Are you going back to that first draw and wiping that or are you going to the last draw that I did and wiping that and then some of the second draw that I did?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

There's an interesting thing that you could do there. For example, you might be familiar with in modern portfolio theory, where you've got this parabola of investible universe and you compute the efficient frontier and then you have this tangency line which is called the tangency portfolio or something and then, if you remember, you pick a portfolio on the tangency line using some utility function, which basically says how risk averse the investor is and then there's also another way of deriving similar results, but I think in a more principled way if you go through ergodic theory and try to maximize time average growth rates of a geometric Brownian motion as a stochastic process, but the point is that this calculation, it gives you another perspective of doing this cost benefit analysis that is more risk sensitive. It's not just looking at expected return and in fact, it lets you derive an optimal amount of leverage without any assumption on an investor's risk appetite, and if you apply this analysis here, this would be like an alternative way of constructing this table so, maybe if you want to talk afterwards about calculating something like that, I think it would be interesting. I had the thought of doing this a couple of months ago, but I never followed through with it. |

It's a little bit easier to reason about potential return versus the stability fee because they're just static numbers that you can plug into Excel but here might be a little bit trickier because one, you have to think about what your risk preferences are and you can observe those from real market prices, you can't synthesize a portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Some of you, you could potentially approximate some of that bullish sentiment so to speak, based on sort of derivative rates on other platforms, like what are the costs for leverage long positions and how much are people taking them on Bitfinex or something like that. There are ways that you could potentially approximate it. I would be really interested in hearing if people have other ideas of ways we could measure that but that was one thing that pretty much I suggested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

All right, so I guess moving on, I mean, this is really kind of open to the floor, but if nobody wants to jump in, one thing I thought we could discuss was gaging when the peg has been fixed, some ideas that, some indicators that I'm looking at are one is healthy two way flow around $1 so trading back and forth basically, not just looking at how much volume is cleared at $1 by itself but making sure that the supply overhang is taken care of, and we see some good back and forth between 99 and 101 or some tighter spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Another indication could be timeframe, the amount of time we're comfortable observing DAI being traded at \$1 before we're satisfied that it's kind of found the right spot, having it trade there for one day is much different than having it be there for a week or two weeks or a month so these are some of the ideas we've been brainstorming internally but we'd love to hear thoughts from the community as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's interesting to me because I don't know what it means but Mateo, do you have access to a mic or would you like me to read that for you? I will read it out unless you interrupt me so Mateo asks, "potentially we could approximate with options analysis, no?" in order to quantify bullishness, I don't know what options analysis is.

My only concern there is that you need a good, efficient and liquid options market in order to be able to refer to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Rich, I know that I shared this idea with you and Cyrus, I've talked to you about it as well but if we go into this crypto economic limit, where technology allows us to do really cool things, then it's possible for a bunch of market makers on this call to provide zero knowledge proofs about certain pieces of information about their inventories, without saying that that's my address, or this is exactly how much I have, and so on and I actually have, this is more than a pipe dream so I've spoken to some researchers on this who believe that not only is this something that is possible with the zero knowledge primitives that have been implemented on Ethereum, but moreover, even from a UX point of view, this is something that might actually be not so far off so I'm just floating this as like, if there's sufficient interest for someone to want to take the lead on this kind of thing, it's something that we could that I think would really kind of benefit this governance discussion in the long run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

We have a granting program. There's a long tail of utility, excuse me on the type of mechanisms that would allow that to happen for the rest of the ecosystem as well, so if anybody is listening and/or Lev, if you have connections, continue to pursue them, please. Let them know that there are resources available to help make that happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Because in that sense, you could even target balances from people that I mean, it's just an idea but you could just basically try to get all the market makers whether or not they opt into this zero knowledge proof and potentially get a more accurate estimate of what the inventory levels are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

That's a good, that's like a kind of parallel thing that you could do. I'm sure at some point, someone's going to come to this call with some kind of bunch of like addresses and some crazy theory about what that means. I certainly speculated about that kind of stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I'm kind of talking about a different thing, which may be less or more valuable, I don't know but it's like someone being able to back up what they're saying with their legal proof that they're honest, which I think has a different role, I don't know, to be honest. I think it would be a good start probably to start with something that doesn't require any opt in, like you said. If someone wanted to work on that, from that perspective, I think that that should be encouraged but in some cases, I think that's not going to give you enough information like obviously, you can get so much more detail from someone telling you about what they have and then also providing a cryptographic proof of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You can see there's been over a million sitting at \$1 for months now, and we haven't hit that yet. We haven't eaten any of that yet but we are starting to see some larger bids in the 96 cent area, which is good, which we haven't seen until the last couple weeks so just looking at the markets themselves will tell you something about whether things are going in the right direction and they are going in the right direction right now fortunately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Incidentally, that is something that we can start to capture and monitor, although I think that's a little bit less of a priority compared to some of the other things we're trying to do right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think that's seriously hamstrung this market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We've had some good luck previously with continuing the call afterwards so if anybody's interested in hanging out and just getting nerdy with money, please do so. Steven, did you want to wrap things up for us and so we can let you go?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Thank you very much for all those that have contributed and really taking this to the next level where we can start talking about very practical solutions to the challenges but other than that, I can put nothing further to add, just a sign of appreciation and thanks once again for joining us on this call.

This is the picture of, this is my dream for what governance calls would be all about so thank you, everybody, for making my dreams come true. Thanks for all the questions. Thanks for all the graphs. If people need to leave, and you still have questions, please continue to ask those questions and link to the discussion thread on Reddit. I will be posting the videos, the audio and the transcripts to that thread. We'll also be continuing the discussion over the course of the next week so if there's any questions or things that still need to be talked about, please do it there. Otherwise, I'm willing to hang out for the next half hour and just take some random questions if it turns out that there's enough interest. If not, we'll put this thing to bed. All right.

It also lets people with hard stops get out of the call in a way that makes sense so \[inaudible 00:52:47\], if you are still around, and in a position to use your microphone, you had an interesting question a while ago that sort of got buried about fixed term and variable term loans. If you want to ask that, it might be an interesting question to talk about. Is he still on the call?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It's something that we've talked about a few times, more than a few times in the past, but every once in a while, it's good to revisit some old territory so, \[inaudible 00:53:19\] asked us a general question, what was the intuition behind not giving DAI loans pre determined expiration rates? Is the case for most other derivatives, most arguments around why DAI should be around \$1 rely on arbitrage arguments wherein CDP holders can arb against the system? If the DAI had expiration terms of like six months, this will open up arb to everyone so Cyrus, maybe can you comment on, this is probably long before your time, but maybe you can comment on some of the thinking behind variable and fixed term loans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think you could kind of implement the fixed term loans as kind of a subset so it's something that could be built on top through some other service, for example. I'm not sure it makes sense. \[inaudible 00:54:30\] If you have a fixed term, couldn't you just when your term is up, you just pay off your loan and then just immediately open it back up again? I know it just kind of causes this unnecessary friction for the end user without a real, lasting benefit to MakerDAO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Doing fixed term, the idea would be you get a fixed stability rate so you get a fixed stability rate for your terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If the fee is fixed, then it is economically different and if you think about it for a little bit, you realize that well, I can't say whether it's good or bad, but it does make the system quite complicated because you then have this stickiness in the yield curve, you get this additional complexity from the fact that the CDPs are not fungible anymore because it depends like when they were created, and when they expire so then you have a market for these CDPs because if rates go up, I don't want to hold the CDP anymore. I might actually want to, they become kind of like bonds, so there's this whole zoo of different CDPs because the CDP that I opened today isn't going to be the same as the CDP that I buy from someone who opened it six months ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

As Rich alluded, there are ways that you could build this on top of a floating fee system with swaps and kinds of derivatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Is a variable, no term loan, kind of the most generalized form of loan that you could have?

Multi Dollateral DAI is on the horizon and it seems that a natural progression there is that since you don't get to put multiple collateral types into a single CDP, I would open up a number of collateral, oh sorry, a number of CDPs across my collateral types, and then I'm pretty diversified in terms of my risk across the board but if I sent all those CDPs to a single point of ownership, like a set protocol token or something or an actual basket of CDPs, then I'm kind of creating an index and so if this becomes a more popular way to hold and manage your CDPs, you can start in theory funneling into an application that consistently refunds or your CDPs across your different hedge positions to maintain your index at a certain thing. If this becomes a more popular thing or an indication of where the market would go, will this become a first party offering through Maker?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The S&P is a really good example so if you had an S&P token, and that became a collateral type for an actual CDP, could you take out leverage against these underlying synthetic assets and then just the concept of bundling CDPs. If I have a number of different CDP, I've taken out, and so ETH is a good example, if you got different collateral types or collateral ratios you could look at, even though I have all ETH from my collateral types, I'm going to have three different types of CDPs open, maybe one that's got a safer buffer on it than other ones and how can I like better manage and maintain those, because I can imagine if I get into the realm of like 10 to 20 CDPs, it's going to be quite cumbersome to manage outside of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They could be bundled in the interface. I mean, if your wallet owns all the CDPs, you might just have a really comfortable interface to work with so you don't necessarily have to do it on the on chain level. That's my kind of intuition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Actually, there's been this notion floating around for a while that the fact that an MCD CDP only contains one asset and when setting risk parameters, the governance can't discount for diversification. In the real world, this is super practical because if you went to your broker and you bought one stock, like I'll say you wanted to get leveraged on Tesla, they would extend margin to you but their liquidation ratio, well that's not what they call it but the equivalent would be pretty high so you wouldn't be able to get more than, I think probably something like 2X or well, 2X to 3X to maybe 5X leverage on a single stock if you were lucky but if you came to a broker with a portfolio of stocks, let's say 20 stocks, 20 names from different industries, you wouldn't have trouble getting 20X, 30X leverage on a portfolio margin basis and that's because, if you have 20 stocks from different sectors, there's just no way that that portfolio could drop like 20% of that et cetera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I mean, I guess maybe futures traders work differently actually, so that's an interesting comparison there but the point is, there's definitely value to what you're saying and it wouldn't need to happen probably at the smart contract level because you need to give governance a way of expressing this view that they are willing to discount for diversification there. If we had hopefully one day, 20 different collateral assets which weren't super correlated, you would actually want to say that liquidation ratio on this should be really, really low and the stability fee should be pretty low, and so on. I think what you're saying is really reasonable and I do think actually that for some of these use cases you need, you need this to be at the contract level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Yeah, I see a lot of, I guess my side of things is, I don't have a deep financial background in terms of traditional assets, but as a programmer, I start collecting and playing with these things, like the management side of things, being able to bundle them and then be able to treat things as a bundle, you can see that like, it would allow you to heavily diversify risk in terms of getting liquidated and managing that side of things and then in terms of repaying debt, you can start looking at repaying some sections of what your collateral types debt are to offset your overall risk preference that you have against your CDP or your outstanding debt, rather than being forced into potentially giving up an asset that you need the utility or the value on or the liquidity of today, but I have a basket of other assets I can pull from the overall manage debt risk level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We'll have Bitcoins once good price feeds for it come out but as we start to take transactions, we'll start to get a better understanding of where commerce is happening on our platform of where ultimately that those tokens are going and that itself kind of creates a signal like a commerce index and so in theory, if you wanted to just hold an index or hold a basket of tokens that are heavily valued in a commerce space, that gives you kind of like, almost like a bottom floor hedge against potential market movements and so I could just, that's where the thought kind of came around bundling assets and how you could use that in a CDP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

There's a more formal way to look at the symbiosis between Maker and these secondary lending markets, which is the comparing kind of in the real economy. Lending is done by a bank and then lending that's done kind of by the market, like when a company issues a bond for example or borrows in some other way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Presumably, there's some level of M1, which is kind of the right amount for a certain economy, which is the amount of cash, not cash, the amount of money that you have in circulation, and some lending expands M1, and some lending doesn't expand M1 and central banks and bank regulators try to exert some influence on this but presumably, you could compare this to our situation with the weak Dai, which is that if DAI is below our target, then it means that M1 has gotten too big and we need to try to do more lending without expanding M1 and that is precisely people lending DAI through Dharma or Compound instead of printing it in Maker and us adjusting the stability fee or other risk parameters is like a central bank doing monetary policy or enacting some regulation on deposit or reserve requirements and this kind of thing to affect M1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They're qualitatively different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I was thanking you for talking about the distinction between these, the lock up on DAI through the secondary markets and whether that actually impacts the demand or the supply that we have lying around. The second question that I have for you though, is, and I always caution that I'm a financial neophyte, so maybe I'm missing something, but we have places like Compound and Lever and Nuo and this whole host of the secondary lending platforms that are very interested in lending DAI and from my uneducated perspective, it seems like the average person will go, well I'm just going to buy a bunch of, convert my fiat to DAI and collect 10% off of Lever or whatever, what have you. Do you have any insight into why that hasn't been a more attractive option for the open market arena?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Basically, I don't know, the market needs to decide what the appropriate rate is. Well, who's to say that the rate that we have now or we had a month ago was the perfect one. You can get very detailed with the answers here, I think certainly like, perceived risk, how people imagine global settlement going and this kind of thing all should factor into it, or it should, if you're in the position of having to make this decision but yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

One, people, there's a subset of people who are familiar with crypto, understand Dai, understand these systems, can get access to these assets so we're already filtering down a fair amount and I think one big effect is once you filter down to that set of people, I think a big portion of those people are spending their capital on actually buying ETH and Bitcoin and going effectively long on these assets leveraged or otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It used to be higher. It also used to be lower, it's variable and I've tried lending on Dharma too. You get some smaller loans that people will take, but a significant volume for me to go and take $1,000, $2,000, buy the DAI and go lend it on Dharma. It's a lot of friction and transaction costs, as has been mentioned on here to get access to that yield if people are willing to take me up on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

There is the spectrum, as I mentioned, of kind of bullish and bearishness in the middle of that spectrum, like there's a very fine line of people who are neutral and would, like I would personally be the type of person that would buy DAI and then lend it out because I'm kind of neutral, but I still want to get some yield but there is in addition to those transaction costs, this uncertainty or this volatility of like, okay, well, DAI price could drop, so I could take a haircut once I'm done lending and then I go to clear my DAI out, or the potential just uncertainty of that yield might not make it worth it to kind of go through all those steps. If we're just a 5% or maybe let's say, my personal cost of capital, which varies based on my risk tolerance is more than 5% and maybe there's something else that I could be doing for a higher yield with dollars, which, in fact, there is, and so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I know a lot of people have been talking about secondary lending in the DSR differently, but my general sentiment is that the DSR will be an important kind of leg to the system and will legitimately improve both the DAI price and kind of the opportunities for yield.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I do think they're different so like the secondary lending actually is, is very significant economically and then the DSR is going to be useful policy tool, but that's not satisfying anyone's need for credit because you're not actually lending to anyone. It's comparable to the interest rate that the Federal Reserve pays on deposits, which is like, it's kind of made up because you're not actually lending to anyone or financing any useful activity. It's just a lever that they have that they can coax things into doing what they want and for us, it's the same. Somehow, it's much more interesting to think about secondary lending than DSR actually because when you think about it, DSR is kind of just imaginary. How economically significant could it be that that the smart contract is just minting DAI without actually financing any productive activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Now it's really hard to say how long it would sit out of the circulation for but if it's not being borrowed and then sold back onto the market, it is effectively being pulled out of circulation and I think helping to pull up the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You could draw from you CDP, put it in Compound and because you have a fixed rate, you get that secondary lending market. Would that sort of simulate something like the DSR or is it again totally different?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

That can also help suck up demand potentially kind of like a DSR, does it have a similar behavior to the DSR?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The central bank doesn't need to make profit, right? MKR holders are interested in making profit so we're a little different in that respect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Central bank can print money whenever it wants. DAI has to be collateralized back all the time so Maker MKR holders are not really this, they don't have quite the same incentives, they are seeking a profit on their capital, MKR holders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I wasn't trying to say that they're the same in every way. It was more but I think there's some interesting analogies and how some of these policy instruments work but yeah, sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If the DSR was live today, how would you determine whether the DAI weakness needs to be solved by increasing risk premium on the collateral due to the demand of leveraging off that collateral versus some sort of general weakness that needs to be fixed to the DSR? Because discussing these last few days, if you have 10 collateral assets, it doesn't make sense to unfairly punish other collateral types that are appropriately risk managed appropriate supply demand and then one collateral type all of a sudden shoots off, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

People will be comfortable paying a higher rate for credit against this, but that also means that the flip side of the coin is that governance has to charge a higher stability fee for it because they're taking more risk.                                                  |

That's very much a tail risk. I mean, to this day, there has never been a liquidation in the system that hasn't recovered the full value of the debt so this is like the black swan of black swans for us because the day that we see that, we're going to forever, it's going to forever change our understanding of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

That's almost impossible to formally calculate because you certainly don't want to just take some, you don't want to take some normal distribution or something for tail risk, because then you're clearly a kind of black swan foolish, so basically the answer is I don't know, but it's like, it just turns out this is actually a really serious problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

They would lather up on ETH like crazy to buy Bitcoin if it was easily purchased through DEX's or whatever, but if you have, so there's a risk premium for the risk of the asset failing or whatever kind of the standard collateral risk, but then it appears that there needs to be a debt ceiling related adjustment like a debt ceiling related DSR specific to the collateral as well, because as a lot of credit or leverage is built off of one collateral, it's not that the market cannot just arbitrarily facilitate this extra demand for credit and there needs to be an adjustment made based on the debt ceiling is how I'm seeing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It's like basically safe to lever off of without getting liquidated because they perceive ETH to be in a rising market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You can do a thought experiment, which is like suppose you're in a market where supposedly, basically what happens, so DAI was stable with the stability fee of 50 basis points, and then later DAI is somehow still struggling to keep up with the stability fee of like, 20% or something. Something has changed in that world and wouldn't you agree that there's at least some chance that the thing that's changed is the risk premium associated with the collateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

There's significantly more tail risk there and the stability fee was half a percent. Now there's \[inaudible 01:26:33\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It's kind of weird if at two different points in time you had it was very low return but high risk and another time it was high, high return low risk because then there's some kind of dislocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Do you get like colored coin Dai, one per collateral type that gets a different DSR so you lock up what got inflated or is oversupplied or is it just going to any Dai?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I mean the collateral specific adjustment I was talking about was not actually a way for people to put their DAI somewhere but rather what kind of additional premium needs to be charged on it. collateral that's causing the peg to drift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You never have more people taking CDPs than you have DAI in existence so if you take a 5% rate from CDP owners, that gets paid 5% to DAI owners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If there's other super pressing questions or conversations to be had, let's go to the chat. It looks like there's going to be a lot of people's breaking off into individual discussions, which I'm super happy about. If there are questions that didn't get addressed in the call, please, I'm begging you at this point, go to Reddit and continue the discussion in the mkrgov thread, but I have a hard stop so I need to bounce out and that means I need to stop recording so thanks, everyone for joining. Thanks, Lev for your deep insights. That was hyper valuable. Let me know what your rates are because I want you back in the next call as well so thanks everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
