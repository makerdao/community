Welcome to the June 20th edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting with MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of the community development. I keep on forgetting that. I believe that's accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Cyrus Younessi is going to introduce us to the wonderful world of collateral risk and everything that entails. I'm not going to describe any more than that because I'll probably use the wrong terminology, so I'll allow him to keep us informed. We'll hear from Vishesh about the state of the peg briefly for about 10 minutes. Cyrus, we're going to dig into his slideshow for the bulk of the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you have questions, comments, please do not feel shy. Jump right in. We have a chat. Type your questions in the chat if you don't have access to a microphone. If you do have access to a microphone, interrupt us whenever you need to and we can have the discussions as they arise. I think that's probably it for the boiler plates. I want to talk briefly about governance issues because we're seeing some interesting things happening again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We might've seen campaigning for the first time, which is great because this is something that we need to encourage as group and support whenever possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They need to know that their involvement can affect people's opinions. It can affect the way that the system works. We had some people pop up in the chat yesterday saying, "OMG, why are people advocating for a lower stability fee?" There was a conversation there. People dug into the graphs and then somebody posted a thread in r/mkrgov saying essentially the same thing. Why are you all advocating for lowering the fee when it should be raised?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We'll leave it to Vishesh to present data about whether that seems to be the most logical option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

They piped up. They had some chats, they made some posts, and then the system changed, and that's very encouraging to me. That's the sunshine aspect. Here's the contrarian view here. We're still in a situation where we're running into voter apathy, and this isn't a surprise. It's not something we weren't prepared for. This is the nature of the game, and we have some questions I think that we need to ask ourselves specifically related to the cadence of voting, the friction associated with voting, our expectation or requirements that the community needs to be engaged on a weekly basis, and they need to education themselves, stay up to date, and then move their keys and/or find their keys and then move their Maker every Friday.                                                                                                                                                                               |

I'm not sure that I'm convinced to do that, and one of the thought experiments that I do, and this is not a complicated one, I ask myself, "Rich, name five projects in the space that you'd be willing to do the same thing for," and the answer is none. I would not do that for any project in this space, so we need to determine whether that's a realistic expectation for asking people to interact with our system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

There's other options that we can explore, and one of those things that I would like to refer everybody's attention to is a recap of these thoughts that I've posted in the r/mkrgov subreddit. Is somebody talking about Rich without a hat? Yeah, today is my baldy reminder day just so it's not a big surprise if I take my hat off six months from now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This recapped some of the questions that we'd asked previously, so they come from the community, come from me, come from these discussions. Are we seeing engagement fatigue? Is 1% increments too fine-grained? Are 10 plus polling options too confusing? Are people tempted to fiddle with the rate if we're moving things up and down by 1%? Are we asking people to vote on weekends? Well, we are. Is that a bad idea or does that not matter? The list of questions go on and on and on. I'm not going to read them all out because I promised I would only talk for five minutes and I've already broken that promise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

That poll is used every week to talk about the stability fees, so in order to change the cadence of the system, we need to figure out a signaling system that's outside of the system that we can use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

He points out one of those things that every once in a while in retrospect seems obvious. Why didn't we do this from the very beginning? He points out that it might be smart to do rate stepping for the stability fees in exponential increases, so instead of 1, 2, 3, 4% plus or minus, we should perhaps consider steps of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8, which allows us to do some fine-grained adjustments to the polls when required, but it also opens the door for us to do drastic changes to the stability and the poll, as well, which might be interesting if we see some dangerous market activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

All right, so if you can see my screen properly, I think the simple answer is things have by and large been going well. For DAI, the price has been broadly stable. There's been a little bit of drift down very slight. So hard to say whether it's a legitimate problem or not, and then we'll talk about supply a little bit. The price as we've seen over the past month, a lot of the past volatility has come down quite a bit, so that's good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

There was this June 15th spike, which I think is a bit of an outlier, something to exclude, and we can go into why, but if you take that data point, it has broadly drifted down a little, but again, very slight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The DAI price has held steady, as well. We haven't seen a strong drift in either direction, but we have seen more of this kind of positive correlation emerge at these higher ETH price levels, which as we've beat to death at this point, was a bit of a reversal from how things had worked in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The supply actually, and this was the blip that I was talking about, has ticked up quite a bit in the past week, or two weeks, I suppose. We've gone up from about 80 million to 85, which is not insignificant, and that coincided very well with the 17.5% decrease and then again to 16.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

What I think there were were a few large positions that had come back to Maker from some of the secondary lending platforms, and that seemed to pretty clearly be a delayed effect from the 16.5% decrease. I don't know if people were maybe waiting to see if that fee would get increased back again or further decreased before they made their decision, but there was definitely some sort of reverse refinancing back to Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Now, that reason I harp on those is you could argue that it was some fundamental change at ETH price, but as we've seen, ETH price did not significantly change in that overall three- to four-week time span.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Those are balancing effects. What's interesting is in the past, we've might've seen that happen and then we would see the collaterization ratio drop as well because were people were getting aggressive and they were really hyper-leveraging on ETH, so even though they may be moving their loans back to Maker, there doesn't seem to be as much of that risk-seeking behavior, so the collateralization ratio has maintained this elevated level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Well, actually, I'm going to break the rules. I have a question. We generally look at secondary lending platforms as being actually led or potentially driving with the stability fee, equilibrium at MakerDAO. I'm curious, though, whether you think that the debt ceiling might have an impact on this function, as well, just one or two steps down the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

There's still a bit of a buffer to that range, but I think the question of how should we think about these secondary lending platforms, what can we learn from that, and to what extent should we let it drive our decisions, ultimately I think the secondary lending platforms are serving this function of eating up inefficiency, so to the extent that the DAI supply significantly outpaces the demand for DAI, secondary lending platforms come in and ease that pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

You might see a significant portion of volume, if everything is properly calibrated, move to the DSR versus secondary lending platforms in the future because, again, it's ultimately economically the same effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Okay, well, it tends to be closer to a dollar, and then Uniswap has this wider spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Okay, ETH price. Okay, so that's for DAI, and for ETH price, what I was looking at for the longer-running average before was these broader trends and the relationship between ETH in the long-term versus ETH in the short-term and how that impacts DAI, because in the past, we were just coming up to speed on this idea that the ETH price relative to the long-term price changes how attractive it is and how much people want to go long or short on it which then impacted DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It's probably a little bit muted now that ETH has come up in price a little bit, but I imagine that relationship still exists and it seems to just be impacting DAI a little bit of less, which is, I think, a positive marker for the resiliency of DAI to that leveraging behavior, because in the past, that leveraging behavior was much more effective at depressing the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Today we're going to start talking a little bit about the quantitative side of things. Okay, so quick recap from last week. Last week, we mainly talked about the qualitative and fundamental side of collateral asset. We looked at a rough sketch on what we want to examine for a particular collateral asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I think it just makes more sense to run through the entire model, and then when we circle back to looking at specific collateral assets, we can get a little bit more detailed on examining an asset and talk about scoring frameworks, but essentially, the goal was to take everything we know about a particular collateral and turn it into some sort of risk rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

What are we trying to do and how are we going to do it? First, a few philosophical goals. The MakerDAO mission, DAI becomes the first unbiased world currency, the tagline for this project. The risk side of things or the decentralized risk function should of course help support that mission, and the role of risk is to promote the stability and integrity of DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

How do we achieve these philosophical goals? I've said it a million times, but we have to patient and prudent. There's no other way around.

I think there is actually still, to this day, a lot of confusion about what the purpose of the different risk parameters are, what exactly are we looking for in the stability fee, and the debt ceiling, and even the liquidation ratio can sometimes be a little bit tricky to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

A few things that I want to emphasize, first is I think the goal should be to keep the model as modular as possible. We want to understand how everything works, but there is inevitably going to be a lot of differences in methodologies. For example, there really shouldn't be any disagreement from one risk team to another from one risk model to another about what the liquidation ratio represents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A lot of intuition is much easier to understand from a theoretical ... If you could have all the data in the world and everything that you needed, how would you go about calculating these parameters? As I mentioned, a lot of these models are just intractable in practice and we absolutely have to find and discuss pragmatic solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We're going to be conservative in a lot of our calculations because I think that's just the prudent way to do it. I think we're going to run our first, not think, we are going to run our first example on ETH. I think it's the only collateral that we can all agree on today that will be part of MCD. Also obviously has the most data. It's most applicable. There's obviously no counterparty risk to ETH, which is nice because I get questions every single day about counterparty risk with a lot of these other collateral types. It's something we can deal with a little bit later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We get to start with a lot of CDP data, which is great, so first is a historical CDP distribution data of collateralization ratios and then obviously our current CDP distribution, as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Per collateralization ratio bucket, we want to track the amount of debt relative to the other buckets over time. That becomes useful. These buckets are arbitrary. We definitely won't be going this granular, but we will be dividing it into several buckets.

Our outputs come in different categories just because there's obviously intermediate steps in the model, so some of the preliminary outputs, obviously our own qualitative framework that we submit and the risk rating that comes out of it, liquidity analysis.

This is going to be somewhat basic. I'm not sure we can avoid it, though, because I think it's important to lay the foundation for how CDPs and MakerDAO even works in the first place. A great contextual starting point, almost like a metaphor, is just traditional loans. CDPs are selfish, DAI-denominated loans, so I think it's extremely helpful to start by looking at how loans are evaluated from a risk perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Okay, so a few different examples, obviously hypothetical. You loaned \$100 to a stranger on the street, you're not getting anything back. That's obvious. You loan some money to a roommate or somebody you trust, they might pay you back or maybe they're only able to get you back a certain amount of it, but alternatively, if you do lend to a stranger who leaves some collateral with you, then that's generally okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We can immediately see that there's like a diverse set of scenarios here and distributions, and we want to be able to capture these different aspects in our models, and from just a simple example, the two areas to focus on are the actual default process and if they had any collateral with you in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In the example of the stranger, you probably get nothing back. If you lend to your friend, you might get some back, but you don't know how much it could be, $30. It could be $50.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Just on average, what do you expect it to get back or alternatively expect to not get back?

One is how much you actually lent out in the first place just known as the exposure amount, the likelihood of not getting paid back or the probability that the borrow defaults on this loan, and then this conditional where, okay, if they have defaulted, are you able to claw any money back from them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This is a pretty general model that applies at a high level to all collateral types. Interestingly enough, this distribution also of course has a variance which describes the range of how bad things can get, and we'll circle back to that a little bit later, but that becomes important later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If you want to go back to the previous slide, although this slide can explain it well, too, how do you think about a default? Defining a default, you could define, let's say, a given liquidation that could be a default, but in that situation, you typically have a positive recovery, well, above-one recovery rate, right, so you can get 10% back?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

One, you could say a default is a liquidation that occurs at below 100% collateralization at which point there is some loss, or you could say it occurs whenever a [inaudible 00:45:49] collateralized and you can just assume that the recovery rate is above one which makes it a little bit more awkward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The best way to do it, and I think really the proper way, is that you define a default when the CDP gets liquidated and then the amount that you're able to recover from the collateral sale gets baked into that loss given default and essentially trying to find out the statistics behind what the auction looks like and how much you're able to recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

They DAO returns the excess collateral back to the CDP user, so they actually can't have a negative LGD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Okay, so you can think of defaults or not-default as a two-state system, very simple, but very instructive. In this branch here, this is where there is no default, one minus the probability of default, and in this scenario, you get back everything or this is what you're owed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Your expected losses obviously, not obviously, but the expected loss is how much you're owed back minus what you expect to get back, and this expectation here is calculated through this branch here, and you do out the calculation and it simplifies nicely to your loss being the likelihood that you don't get your money back times the amount loaned out times the amount that you've lost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Expected loss is capped at zero in traditional models.

You might get back 30. Let's just assume it's a 50/50 chance. The loss given default is 70%. Exposure amount is 100. Your expected loss is $35, so as the lender, you're expecting to lose \$35 on this loan, or 35%, and intuitively, a lender would require some compensation for this in the form of a risk premium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It's just a break-even where over time if they were to repeat this loan a bunch of times, this is what would cause them to break even. The point here is we're trying to create a framework where you have an outstanding loan and you want to be able to quantify what is the expected amount that you will get back or what's the expected amount that you'll lose and then trying to derive the risk premium from that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Because obviously the ones I chose were extremely arbitrary. Trying to figure out what is the likelihood that any loan such as a CDP or anything else will liquidate is quite difficult. Even more difficult is trying to estimate or forecast how much you're expected to lose if there is a default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

That's what credit scores are for where they say, "Based on your credit history, we've assigned you this score," and generally people with this score have a 10% frequency of defaulting on their loans, and they can just do this through a lot of data mining and looking at historical data over the past hundreds of years of loans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A key aspect here is that when defaults do happen, there are still additional repercussions that sometimes aren't talked about often enough and are actually important here, and these repercussions are, for example, debt collection and sometimes lenders try to come after your personal assets through the legal system. There's a whole bunch of stuff that happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Now, oftentimes for good reasons, lenders sometimes prefer collateral as part of the loan. It's not necessarily the case that people just go around getting loans with just nothing on the line. It happens in some cases, for example, student loans, but there are many cases where lenders will require collateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If there's default, you, in many cases, just maybe lose nothing. It reduces the expected loss. Also, more importantly reduces the variance of your losses, which leads to some nice properties. As a very simple example, a secured loan is a mortgage where the collateral is the property, and in some cases, the collateral incentives repayment. Nobody wants to lose their home, but for a mortgages, there's two ways this loan can go bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Oftentimes there's insurance purchased on the collateral value falling, so in a lot of ways, they're still focused on the likelihood of repayment, but additionally, house prices are typically stable and obviously we know that ETH is not, so we have to focus on the collateral of course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A CDP has no term, has no scheduled payments. There's really no such thing as nonpayment in a CDP. Default is now purely occurs when an asset hits some threshold. The loss given default is now what the expected liquidation value of the collateral is, and these become the two main parameters that we need to reason about as we continue our models, so this probability of default essentially becomes how can we reason about, what is the chance that ETH just tanks to, whatever, 150, 200, and how much can we get from the liquidation process?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

What is the rationale behind the likelihood that that additional 150 million can suddenly be drawn or not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

As I said, a lot of this fairly academic and theoretical, and we'll see that in practice it doesn't work out as nicely as we'd hope, so we will explore some, not nonacademic, but non-theoretical models, as well. Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We should probably try to figure out whether there's any questions. There was a lot of data there to go over. If anybody does have a question, pipe up now. Feel free to jump on the mic or type a question into the group chat. Cyrus, I'm wondering. Because the volume of data that we're going through in these calls, and we're going to go through, waiting for a finalized slide at the end of it might be a lot to review. Is there any way that we can get pieces of the slides we looked in the meeting just like a tiny little deck that we can post to the thread?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

All right, so maybe people are absorbing things. If we don't have questions related specifically to the risk presentation, we can revisit it in the thread after the summary has been posted. Give people some time to review. Matthew, I didn't ping you earlier to see whether you had a weekly recap for us this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I talked a bit about how we saw this first example of campaigning arise in the system where previously the weight up until just the 11th hour was at 15. There was some discussion about how potentially it should be raised instead in the threads, and the Maker was moved into a 17 for the next [inaudible 01:01:54] next Friday. That's the 20th, that's right. Tomorrow we're looking at adding an executive for 17.5, which is a potential raise from the 16.5 we're at right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In addition to all the parts Cyrus was outlining about how we're going to to identify risk, it's also going to be how we can maintain the natural risk distribution of every type of collateral that'll be brought on to this system from something that is in theory riskless or as much of it as possible all the way to the stuff that's really risky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If the intent is to use those metrics and those three metrics only to identify and control the risk for a given, we'll call it, asset package that we're going to put out as collateral, the challenge, one of the, I guess, questions I have would be when we starting having the identical type of collateral behind it, say for example, ETH, and we have a different collateralization ratio or a different liquidation ratio, the risk is different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Because there's a natural tendency to bring that risk, and the ability to vote on it brings that number down. That of course is one of the questions, and that's one of the points that I wrote about was how we can try to identify that and scenarios where asset classes, excuse me, asset packages basically become less risky, how they can be, in effect, refinanced, and when they become more risky, how you, in effect, drop the debt ceiling to zero and force new debt to be, in effect, priced at a higher rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

That's the point. It's similar to how circuit theory works with gigantic loops and circuits put together. It's simultaneously computed. That point is we don't want to calculate, excuse me, you want to calculate the DSR and you don't want to set it manually because of the fact that what we want to do is have the DSR be calculated and wait a week and realize that it didn't fix the problem, that we're not adjusting the risk premiums correctly, that DSR can't be the savior for a risky asset that mints a bunch of DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Let's call it a base risk premium for now. Now, for whatever reason this asset triggers, and let's just assume the DSR is zero, for some reason when DAI gets minted off of this collateral asset, DAI will be trading below a dollar not because of anything necessarily to do with the collateral itself, but rather there's just not enough demand from people holding DAI, and that's why the DSR comes in to ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It seems like there's two separate issues. One is how do you determine whether risk parameters have been properly calibrated versus do you need to change the universal nature of the function of the DSR and make it more targeted? My question is, okay, I understand that if there is oversupply, it is very simple to say the DSR should be calibrated to soak up that oversupply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Imagine for a moment we only have a risky asset like ETH and let's say the DSR is 5% and everything is fine, then we add a completely risk-free asset that generates a ton of DAI and the supply outpaces and the DAI prices falls. Would you then penalize that risk-free asset for having impacted the DAI supply negatively?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It's not realistic to say, "We're going to recalibrate every single one of them every time we add any one asset," but we have to determine if an asset that was added or in fact all of them, if the risk profile as it compared to the system a whole, stayed the same, became better in terms of risk, or became worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It's not a two-sided scale. It's many-sided, and if all of the scales are out of wack because one particular scale is over- or under-weighted, I don't think it's a great solution to try to solve all the relative weightings of those scales versus if there's one particular asset that is disproportionately drawing out supply because the risk parameters for that asset make it too attractive or too easy to do so, then ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Yeah, but you can't change the collateral ratio or liquidation ratio after a given collateral package, but ignore the collateral packages out there. That's the equivalent of saying, "Hey, I'm going to give you a house mortgage. Your house is your collateral, and that's great. We're going to have an 80/20 deal, 20% equity," and then you start paying and I'd say, "Hey, wait a second. The risk profile just changed. Now it's a 40% equity deal," and you say, "But wait a second. That's not what the deal was when we started," but it triggered a liquidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

We've talked about this. There's going to be many different types of CDPs for a given collateral, so it's not necessarily about, for a given loan, changing the terms of that loan after it's been issued, but rather making loans that are in that range of types that we deem to be unfair, let's say, more expensive, so that people get priced out of those particular structures because those particular structures are improperly calibrated or unfair and that effectively would also push people towards those higher collateralization ratio CDPs because even though it's a higher collateral requirement, you can make it ultimately less expensive by changing what the premiums are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Again, let's say you have 50 million DAI from ETH generated and then add some super safe bonds, and then another 50 million DAI is minted, and let's assume that the risk parameters for both ETH and the bonds were properly calibrated, so you have ETH in there sitting in there for a year. DSR is 5%, no problems, nothing. Let's say 1%. You have no issues, and then a year later, bonds come in super safe, you have the right parameters, and because there's demand to leverage off of it, another 50 million DAI is minted and there just wasn't enough demand for DAI to keep up with this new 50 million batch of DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

We're going to know what collateral package is minting DAI or burning them accordingly. The real question is the other way around. It's not if you introduce a bond that's very riskless. JP Morgan issues a debt, we tokenize it, and you borrow a bunch of money against it.

If you have 50 million DAI that's printed from your left hand or from your right hand, that has nothing to do with the risk.

Continue down that thinking, what you really should do is price the debts, excuse me, price the CDP that was causing this oversupply of minting of demand. You should increase the premium to the point where we need the amount of outstanding to go down. Using the DSR to absorb that would be systemically increasing the risk to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It needs to be weighted to the less risky assets because risky assets need to be priced correctly with a risk premium, and risky assets that have a higher risk premium, if the risk premium is too low, they will mint not-correct amounts of DAI which cause an oversupply which can degrade the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

There's things to be addressed here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

That's an hour and a half for a call. I think that we should probably stick a fork in this one. Sorry, continue the discussion, please, in the r/mkrgov sub-reddit. We have a thread designed for specifically this purpose. I'm posting another link. We'll have a summary in there soon of all the [inaudible 01:31:21] points that came out of this call. All right, let's continue the debate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
