Welcome to the April 18th edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. This is our thirty first call, so congratulations to everyone for surviving this long, it's a bit of a milestone, it's an achievement in my books. It's not easy to keep momentum up on these things so I'm very encouraged to see the number of people that are continuing to join these calls and engage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

What's happening here is interesting, it's unique and we're all on the forefront of this very new and unusual wave of online or \[inaudible 00:00:38\] governance and so thanks again for joining. Keep the preamble light, we are desperately interested in getting as much engagement as we possibly can from this audience today, so if you have a question, please type it in the chat on the side. We'll ask it if you don't have access to a microphone, if you do have access to a microphone please jump in at any time and ask your questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think that's it from me Steven, I'm gonna hand it off to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Well, to reiterate what you're saying and like ... firstly, hello everybody and thank you for actually participating on these calls. I must admit that last week, we may have had a record turnout, and I'm certainly hoping we can take that momentum forward because the contributions that are coming in, the work that's getting done, the ability to facilitate it's just improving from week to week, so and you know, just on that basis, you know, thank you very much. But, you know, one thing I like to do is just reiterate every single week exactly what the themes are that we cover. I think it's crucial to know these themes because it defines very clearly the spectrum of the risk that is considered in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The second, clearly covers the collateral types that we will start presenting in the future, the collateral portfolio as a whole, the parameters to those collateral types and parameters ... and portfolio and the adjustments to those as well. I know that was a bit of a mouth full, but really it's all about collateral types. And then, the last theme that we'd like to cover in these calls are the exogenous risks to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Really great examples of how contributions in the background are starting to, you know, show real merit and gives us a good sense of how to keep the momentum going. But, again, you know, keep in mind this is decentralized scientific governance and ultimately, what is considered here is being facilitated by the foundation in this very short hour, with the objective of helping MKR governance to make decisions and needs. And, again, and I will always keep reminding everyone that this is a continuous function, governance is a continuous action, so please be involved as much as possible. On that note, turnover to Rich again if you don't mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So, thank you Steven that's a great introduction and also it provides me a useful segway because a constant theme the last four or five calls has been this idea that governance needs to iterate over time and, we're constantly identifying additional challenges. Maybe the theme or the name of this segment should be 'who would have guessed that governance is hard' because that's sort of the thing that we're figuring out, there's edge cases that need to be dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We've seen some interesting behaviors arise from those mechanisms, we've iterated a bit over the last couple of weeks, where it became apparent that we really needed to tighten up the cadence of how we initiate a poll, how we discuss those results and how we initiate a vote and most importantly, how quickly we can encapsulate that entire process. The idea is that we wrap that up in a seven day period, that allows the community to have enough agility to respond to market pressures and adjust to the peg as they see fit. It also allows the organization enough breathing room to handle the mechanics in the backhand and the intendant steps that it takes to actually get that ... those proposals showing up in the portal, which are ... I won't bore you with it, but are not inconsequential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So, that was a mysterious little preamble. I'm going to provide some detailed context and, or order to do that I am literally just going to read what I wrote, what I posted in the sub Reddit, so if I sound stilted and or mechanical for a while it's because I'm literally just reading things out loud. I'm posting the link as well for people that want to read along with me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

On Thursday, we get together and talk about how the poll went and discuss other issues. On Friday, we throw up an executive vote, which presents a new picture, a new state of the system that can be chosen by voters that contains the winning poll option. So, basically in the mall that we've been playing with so far it's whatever number had the most signal from the poll, it was the number shows up for the stability fee and the executive vote and then we all determine whether we want to support this new picture of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And, in the past, we've also had the satisfaction of seeing that executive vote be ratified within ten to twelve hours, same day basically, tremendous amount of MKR moves from the old state of the system into the new state. That creates a great deal of clarity and then that free us up to have a bit of a weekend before we begin this process over again following Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This week is a perfect example of the poll where I pulled out some rough numbers but for the leave things alone option we have nineteen percent of the turnout, by "raising it by one" is zero percent of the turnout basically. "Two percent" is twenty three percent of the turnout. "Raise it by three percent" is thirty eight. "Raise it by four" is eighteen. So, that's number a number soup but there's no clear, clear winner in the poll that we have this week. We have a range of options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Alright, and then this model we saw that activity, but very little of it. Twenty one hundred MKR move from three percent to four percent since last night, so there is some juggling, but not much. So we're in the situation right now where we have sort of an ambiguous poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

But, that's a largely uncoordinated and organic series of capitulations and negotiations that need to happen offline, so I can't really speculate too much on what that might look like. But, to get in ... or to pick up the thread though, so we have a situation we have sort of an ambiguous poll and that creates some issues where we need to decide, well, if we have four options in poll with five options and only one of them is in the lead by whatever, ten percent, is that really a situation where we need to through the rigmarole of having an executive vote, so I'm gonna leave that question open for now and I'm gonna go back to another problem that we saw in the system over the weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

That was placed into an executive vote and we also sort of, I don't know who we all are, I sort of sat around on Friday and waited for the end of the day and to see who won, and it was very clear that nobody won in that picture. And, on Saturday, nobody ... there was no clear winner as well and on Sunday, there was no clear winner as well and that was probably because I needed to tee up the next poll for the system on Sunday and that made me ask a very uncomfortable question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It presupposes that there's an executive, that there's a clear state of the system, with which we're basing these increases on and if there is no perception of a clear state of the system, we run into some situations. We don't know what to poll on on Friday and I wanna bring some clarity around that because this is kind of a hard one to wrap your head around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We add a new executive vote and then people can, MKR token holders can decide whether they prefer the new system or the old system and I think that we've fallen into a trap where we assume that the new picture of the system is better because it's new and it's more recent and it has up to date thinking behind it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And then we have state number three which is there is actually a disagreement where there's a significant number of voters who have no intention of moving into the new picture of the system, they're happy where things were and they're not going to move their MKR. That creates ambiguity because that means that we don't know which state of the system we're polling for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So, having a poll that is dependent on a known quantity for the system is very difficult.

So, that puts us into a position where we can start talking about are we voting for relative increases or absolute increases? So ... but that also leaves us in sort of this gray area because if it's absolute, there's a poll for raise the stability fee to eleven percent or something, fifteen percent and then at some point during the course of the week a new executive was ratified that is ... sets the stability fee to fifteen percent, then that poll is now invalid. Or, if the ... well, I guess that's enough of an example there, because of the sands are constantly shifting underneath, the polling system, even relative and absolute values have a potential for being signaled for but no longer appropriate and then we'd have to be in this position where we are presenting executive votes for a system that no longer exists or we're in a situation where we're vetoing polls because they no longer make sense and that's a risky situation to be in, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I mean, I guess, I'm trying to ... like if you fast forward what you were just saying to the part of if you just had a vote every ... and I'm just making it simple right now ... even minus two, minus one, the delta is the question, the real number is the absolute. So, if we're at eleven and a half now, the vote maybe should have minus two, minus one, zero, one and two. And that's just the executive vote, and it should be a continuous role, but you're really not voting for the change. We really, in my view, should really be voting for what we think the actual end stability fee would be. We logically should know what the state was beforehand and so it's very similar to these telegram polls that they run, where you can retract your vote and cast a different changing vote and it's just a live continually voting system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So, the MakerDAO principles, or we should do X, Y and Z in the real world or something. The executive votes primarily are to execute an new state of the system and so one of the questions I've been asking myself is is it not the correct place to be polling for a range of options, when instead, possibly, there should be a range of the options that are simply placed into the executive voting system and that's simply it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So, I've done, hopefully I've done an adequate job in explaining the conundrum that we're facing here. I don't expect us to spend the rest of the call digging into the minutia of this, I just wanted to put it on people's radars and encourage them to come into that thread that I posted in the chat and give us some suggestions. But, I'm gonna leave some ... I'm gonna make the water even murkier by adding some questions that are of standing, so ... We also ran into another issue where there potentially could be a disconnect between the demographic that's engaging with the polls versus the demographic that's engaging with executive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

But, perhaps people that are willing to vote in a poll are not willing to vote in an executive. So, we might be seeing a disconnect between signals and what large holders actually are hoping to see. It could be vice versa, large holders have to deal with custodians, they have a lot of multi sigs and they have to dig things out of safes in order to access to the ledgers. So, maybe they're willing to go through those hoops in order for an executive, but they're not willing to go through that hoop just to signal some information on a poll. It's hard to tell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

One of the things that I wanna get some clarity on is are we allowing enough time to pass between an executive and a poll, and this is something that we didn't get into today, but it's something we need think about. So, we have an executive on Friday and then the following Monday we kick off another poll, so the intervening weekend, is that enough time for the market to react, is that enough time for people to understand the new state of the system, is there any breathing room here, you know. And is it just a fantastically inconvenient time for people to be moving their tokens out of cold storage, something we need to think about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We have an existing picture of the system, we've put in an executive and after two days, three days, five days, it doesn't reach a majority, does that mean we can all assume that this is a weak proposal and is there any utility in even having it in there. So, there's been a lot of options thrown around where we can potentially start thinking about thresholding, this amount of MKR needs to vote in order to have an executive. This executive needs to have enough MKR in it to be valid and if after x number of days there's not ... there's like five percent of MKR in the new executive after five days, maybe it just gets cleaned out and goes back into the old executive picture and we clean up the system that way. I'm not sure, that might actually break some of the fundamental assumptions of how we've designed this thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So, let's continue the discussion. There's been some interesting discussion, there's been some interesting solutions presented in the chats already. They need to be fleshed out a bit, so, I'm going to leave that there unless somebody has a link to how to fix governance that we can all enjoy, where they have a magical solution for us, if not ...

So, today we're gonna hear from as mentioned two members of our risk working group. Vishesh has spoken in the past and he will be kicking off the state of the peg today. We're also going to have Primoz with us to report on CDP statistics and I've realized we've never really had them give proper introductions, so Vishesh and Primoz if you want to give a quick bio please feel free. And, tell everyone else, as you all know, we're pushing hard on this decentralized risk governance approach. If you're interested in getting involved, please reach out to me and with that I'll hand it off the Vishesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Yeah, so just as far as quick introductions I'm not sure if I've ever introduced myself properly on the call but I am computer science and biology by education, worked in, you know, the academic space in a lot of hard science research fields and then ... since then, got involved with a few tech startups, particularly a health insurance startup that I worked at for a couple of years where we did a lot of kind of analytics and risk-modeling and financial modeling. Since then, moved onto a crypto focused research firm last year and then just in the past month or so, I've kind of broken off and kind of started doing consulting on my own and publishing, you know, graphs and tweets and posts a little bit more publicly. Just kind of trying to get a little insight and analysis out there and into the space and into community calls like this, so we can help inform what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Okay. You can see these graphs. So, here was the price peg, so essentially the previous stability fee increase was around March 22nd and the most recent one was April 14th, so what we saw was basically the price peg had been kind of declining for a while and I think that rate of decline had kind of slowed or come to a head with a bit of a valley just before the most recent increase. But, that was following a huge spike in transaction volume. What we saw in the last few days since the increase was a drop in that transaction value but the ... again we should discount it because it's a lighter volume but there price peg, starting to recover a little bit from that sort of ninety five ish, ninety six ish low to about ninety seven to most recently and then I think Lev was showing similar numbers, on stablecoin.science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

With the previous increase, we were dealing with an ecosystem were ETH price was rising. With the most recent increase we have sort of seen a few points dip in the ETH price. Now, I think the overall view is sort of lukewarm in the sense that it looks like we're starting to get a little bit more healthy stability back into the system, but again, with lower trading volumes and with ETH price having come down in the last few days, we should probably discount like how much we can attribute that purely to the stability fee increase versus other independent variables outside of the Maker ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

I think it's a continued trend that's been observed, a bit of an inverse relationship in terms of what's going in with ETH and what happens with DAI. On the supply side, so, I think positive again, indicator, but wanna keep things tempered is since the few days before the most recent stability fee increase, there was a bit of a ramp up in the outstanding supply. But, I think that tends to happen just before an increase and then after that increase that supply has come down a bit, mainly I think due to the large volume of MKR get .. of DAI getting wiped on April 15th, which was the day after the increase. I'd also ... a separate thing that is not shown here that I kind of tweeted out, just following a few transactions, there were a few big transactions where people were borrowing DAI on secondary platforms like Compound and Dharma and then going ahead and using that to pay down their CDPs, which I think was kind of the behavior that we try to incentivize with increasing the stability fee, is to just kind of make it a little bit more expensive so that people consider wiping down their debt. And they are in, what I'm seeing, taking advantage of some of those secondary platforms as a lever, or an alternative platform to obtaining DAI. |

Like can you ... how many more times do we need to do this before you can say that the last two to three stability fees had these effects and we just saw it affect again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I think we're sort of at that stage where we're seeing some motifs, some patterns, that, you know, we can maybe start to make some very light predictions on and then kind of test the quality of those trends by how well they hold up to what we see in the next couple of iterations I would say. But, I think we certainly probably need at least a few more weeks before we can start to say anything for sure, because I think the real trick is we want to see a variety of independent environmental conditions, right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And, I think there's just been too much noise and too many independent variables changing and a lot of changes that we've been making, to really draw like historical trends or conclusions right now, it's just too \[crosstalk 00:31:25\] I feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

These compound graphs have stability fee graphed as well, but I can drops some pins on the other ones for when those increases were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So, just as mentioned before, transaction volume, big spikes just post the previous increase and then this was actually something that we had mentioned last week, was that transaction volume was healthy. It has been dropping since then, but I think that is a little bit natural in terms of what's been going on in terms of the outstanding supply. I think it's primarily been people wiping down debt which is the healthy behavior that we're looking for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

More recently, it's been cheaper to get ... Oh, sorry, it had been cheaper to get DAI from Maker, but now that we've made that a little more expensive, I think what we've seen is fewer people taking their DAI, getting it from Maker and supplying it on these secondary lending platforms. But, I think a healthy, semi-sustained level of people when they're in a crunch, going to those platforms and getting DAI and using it to wipe down their debts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Whereas, in the past, there's been a ton of activity of people just drawing out DAI willy nilly and then supply it on these platforms to try and get some kind of yield because it was really cheap to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So, in terms of the volume, as I had mentioned last week there had been this kind of continual uptick of the supply and borrow volume on these platforms, slight dip just post the stability fee increase in terms of the amount being supplied. That has recovered a little bit, I think that was a lot of people essentially trying to reclaim access to some of their DAI to try and wipe down debts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This is something that was discussed a little bit last week that I wanted to just show, to answer a couple of questions. The questions that we've gotten were like when people are drawing out DAI, are ... is it new CDPs that are drawing out DAI, or is it existing CDPs that are kinda levering up their amount of debt?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And so, essentially, what we see is ... and then I did just the nine day simple moving average and then graphed the ratio of the two as well. So, what we've seen which is kind of interesting is since just before the last stability fee increase, more draws on new CDPs and then that kind of falls off. And, then, just leading up to the next increase more draws on new CDPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And then when that ETH price starts to fall a little bit, we do tend to see ... we did see some liquidations as well, a little light compared to in the past obviously, because it was a very small drop in price. But, in the past month or so we have not really seen very many liquidations. So, again, that drop in ETH price does tend to be a healthy moving the sludge through the pipelines kind of factor for Maker, in my opinion. Sorry, i don't wanna take up too much time. So, I think that was the gist of what I wanted to show today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The one thing that I'm trying to understand as well is ... so, my understanding is when you borrow from Compound, the collateral that you post, you're also supplier for. So, you're earning interest on your collateral.

It may be the case that the borrow rate is very, very close to the current stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And so, if you discount from twelve six versus eleven five, it's probably very close, it think that's accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

No, it is, you're paying ... your debt is lower than your collateral by value so one of them is ... maybe you don't need a lower interest rate, but if there's more of it and so potentially it could even be higher, depending on what the rates are are, I don't know what the supply rate is for ETH or whatever equivalent on Compound right now. Like, yeah, I would also be curious right now that we've seen a lot of Dharma and potentially looking at those rates here more seriously as a thing. Though, in the past, we have discussed the issue of subsidy and looking at other secondary lending platforms that are now getting some volume and looking at data from those. But, anyway, that's a good thing, so potentially we could be coming to a point where it's ... where we're getting close between Maker and Compound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I'd encourage everyone to just go use the interface to see that, you know, there definitely subsidizing those rates up to a million bucks. And, I wounder if Compound is doing something similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So, just really short introduction of myself and my team because I have a lot to show you today and we don't have much time. So my background is in financial risk management. I currently run company called Block Analytica which focuses on crypto fundamentals, research and investing. We're a team of three and we're based in Slovenia in Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I made this in Google Sheets and it's not automised yet, so hopefully you will soon such things online, and in more user friendly environment. Further bureaus are working on addressing DAI on chain transaction and white listing certain addresses to get familiar with DAI demand because I believe currently DAI demand is mostly unknown and the most important ... yeah, you could call it variable, when addressing supply and demand imbalance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Hope you can see this. So, yeah, basically I know that CDP debt is pretty concentrated, around few hundred CDPs, although there is more than, I think, two thousand active CDPs out there. My goal was to see what amount of CDPs had some sort of impact when it comes to debt issuance and the repayment on daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So, we can see here that twenty ... two hundred fifty largest CDPs, they already represent ninety percent of whole debt. Nevertheless, for the research we used a thousand CDPs, the whole history of them which corresponds to ninety eight percent of whole debt. Here we can see historical data, but obviously I'm not going to go through the variables here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We focus on last 10 days because there was a lot of wipe activity in this period. This graph is pretty much similar what we use to look at mkr.tools, but I converted everything to DAI so it's easier to compare. As expected, there was a lot of lock and draw activity in the first half of the period, when ETH price was rising and there was a lot of free and wipe activity in the second half of the period when ETH was falling and also stability fee was announced to get increased at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Yeah, what we wanted to do next is to see how much of this activity, so this, our total DAI numbers, values, for each type of event, so lock, draw and wipe and we wanted to see how much of this activity is presented by top single events. So, to see just like the maximum wipe on particular day, how much of total wipe on that day this will present that. And, interestingly, it represented about third of the activity and it's only one event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

You could say like five top event represent three quarters, at least three quarters of all activity on that day. And for specifically, for wipes which were pretty high on those days, on the second period, yeah, these top five events represented like three quarters. But, these five events are not necessarily from five different CDPs, so here specifically, this were only two CDPs. So, I think it's ... this huge concentration of activity per CDP is something that's probably going away with time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So, this was exactly what we wanted to do next, perform some kind of on chain analysis or to see if these CDPs on this particular day, if they actually freed ETH from collateral, used it to buy DAI on the market and actually helped to restore the peg because this was the point of increasing the stability fee, right. So, usually ... The usual pattern you can see on chain when people ... when CDPs build leverage, they make these iterations. They draw DAI and then they convert it to ETH and then they lock ETH and they make bunch of iterations and they built leverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And, also, on this two days we could see that DAI price increased, so I was hoping that I would be able to connect wipes and people actually buying DAI back to repay the debt with this increase of DAI price and higher volume. And it wasn't necessarily the case, so, let me show you this. So, these are two CDPs on those two days. Just a second. So, on those two days there was four million of DAI being repaid, there was four million of wipes and four million point four of ETH in dollar value being created. And, eighty percent, up to eighty six were just from these two CDPs. So, you just look at on chain of these CDPs and see how they behave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So, he actually deposited like in many chance ETH to HitBTC converted it to DAI and repaid his debt. Now, why did you do that? Obviously because of higher stability fee and also because ETH price was falling at that point, I wouldn't say his collateralization ratio was low, that he needed to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

He actually did it, but perhaps not so good thing is that he actually used HitBTC, so, that's why we can't fully see this straight here. If we were including this data, HitBTC, obviously on this two days, price of DAI should be a bit higher so it would look much better to state in other words. And, also, one interesting fact, I was actually amazed HitBTC has ten million of DAI deposited there. So, obviously some people are actually using HitBTC to trade DAI it's ... I am not sure, there are rumors about wash-trading but just one interesting thing about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Why did he ... how did he perform the ... how did he bought DAI and we couldn't actually see any of the major venues, be it the decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges. We could see where the funds came from, but we're not sure, was it ... It could be that there was OTC desk in the middle, it could be that were some spare DAI somewhere although I don't believe it. Or, it could be that it was borrowed on some secondary lending platforms and I'm pretty ... really not sure, it's hard to say. But, we are really certain that none of these wipes on these two days where we thought, okay, this is helping with the peg. It didn't actually, this trades that we see here, I guess they were mostly associated with some guys going, hedging their positions and buying DAI because ETH was falling at that point. I guess it's related with that.                                                                                                   |

Just the last thing and then I've finished. This is something that we played a bit recently. It doesn't have to do with what I just presented. It's just we tried to estimate the leverage of CDPs, I think that's one metric that I'm kind of missing is basically something you can adjust from collateralization ratio, but what I was curious about was how much people actually lock their own money inside versus how much of the collateral they have, right, and collateral is of course made by borrowing. So, that's the point of leverage long. And this number is aggregated number for thousand CDPs and I was ... I thought it was going to be higher but it's not really, it's one point four six and I think it's a good metric to have because if you can monitor it through time, you can assess some kind of risk position of CDP holders, how they behave two time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So, my first takeaway, or my immediate takeaway from this was that, you know, earlier this week when we saw like three, four million DAI reduced, you know wasn't ... it was just from literally just a couple people they were just going to HitBTC and to me that doesn't really seem like the kind of response we're hoping for. Does anybody else agree? I mean, do you guys get what I'm trying to say, I mean we're not triggering any kind of mass closures or big supply reduction in any meaningful percentage of the community, it just seems like just the fringe, kind of like the fringe market makers who are just still playing with idle capital, you know, just kind of ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Cause I've been trying to wrestle with this myself and do we have a distributed demographic of ... at the top end, we have people with a high or very risky profile and/or potentially smart money behaving in a vastly different manner than the majority of the other CDP holders and if that's the case, is it possible for us as a community to try and find actions that would move them without moving everybody else at the same time, if that makes sense.

It all comes from the collateral ratio and the collateral ratio, I posted about it and I've thought about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

You know, the stability fee's gone really ... I mean, sorry, the price and the peg has gone really wonky over the past, let's call it, six weeks and in that six weeks, you know, looking at that spreadsheet that I just put. The first time that we've actually had any kind of recovery is when we've actually been within those upper and lower bounds in our ... like when the stability fees actually fit those upper and lower bounds, I mean it's not ... I haven't been super diligent on it, just cause I don't have time, but I would really, really, really, really encourage people, if they can, to sort of crack open that rabbit hole. And, I think what they'll find is this is the best guiding compass for us determining what the stability fee should be. So -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

With the top of the hour though, I don't want to silence you, so if people want to hang out and talk about whether the collateralization ratio is the magical number that we haven't been paying attention to. Let's continue the call afterwards, but, it's late in a lot of places in the world and people have meetings. So, Steven did you still want to give us a thought, before we shut things down?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And I'll also leave it up to Rich, but again, thank you very much for you participation folks, really appreciate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I'm not sure what we do in this situation because we've had a couple of really interesting conversations post call. I've been in the habit of stopping the recording and ... but potentially people might be missing some interesting things, so maybe today is an experiment and we'll continue to record if people have questions they wanna ask and see how that shakes out. So, Michael like I'd be interested in hearing a bit more because in my mind the collateralization ratio is sort of this following indicator, and I'm not sure if I'm using that term correctly, of overall health of the system, the recent changes in the price of ETH and its sort of knock on effect on how healthy or unhealthy positions are. Using that as an indicator that shows an immediate ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If you look at the PETH pool of how big the PETH pool is, right, which is the underlying count of assets, so if you go, you know, two million ETH or let's call it PETH whatever, that's been relatively constant and the thing that swells and, you know, expands and contracts is gonna be the collateralization ratio because you look at the consistency of the PETH pool is about, you know, within one or two percent and that basically says people aren't putting more in. Or, the system's not getting more or, you know, having more withdrawn overall like within one or two percent, yet, for some reason, it's swell up to four hundred and twenty percent collateralization ratio, down to three hundred and fifty percent and that's ... It becomes this very organic indicator that is the core foundation of everything which is, are people growing the system and putting more PETH in or are people getting out of the system?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I'm hoping people that understand the system or the interplay between the market and MakerDAO can chime in with some deeper insight. It just still feels like this is ... the collateralization ratio is a blending of a few others, risk appetite, recent prices in ETH -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So, let's say ETH was worth ten times as much as it is today, so the demand for levering up on ETH specifically is gonna be much lower, but you'll have a lot higher collateralization ratio. So would that necessarily lead to a weak DAI price?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You could have a five thousand percent collateral ratio, and if it's a one to one peg between the environment in which people trade and exist, which is going to be the on chain markets, versus the off chain oracles, that delta, if there's no delta between those, you can have a zillion percent collateral ratio and it's not going to affect the stability fee. Like, it's still going to be one to one and it's gonna be smooth sailing. Cause basically ... Well, the premise that I'm talking about is oracles are one thing, the collateral ratio is a very organic indicator of the environment itself and if we look at on chain trading where we're saying, DAI to ETH should be the same as USD to ETH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And, it's like look, whatever dude, that's America. In KRW, or South Korea we have regulatory restrictions and capital outflow restrictions so we're gonna pay a thirty percent premium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It's, you know, you can't compete against the environment and whether that's through put constraints, regulatory accessibility and it ... Yeah, I think that's largely why there is a lot of ... that's factored in in this model, yeah.

Like, let's assume we were at a dollar right now, and then we were to see a, you know, a sharp ETH move, you know, how can we ... I mean we would have to create a model that would, you know, input ... so, I mean but this ... isn't this just going back to just inputting the ETH prices as a factor into determining what the stability fee and everything should be. I mean if the collateral ratio is just derivative of ETH price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I mean right now it's kind of somewhat tapered out around two point one million and it hasn't really launched higher. So, extract what you want from that. Maybe there are ninety eight million ETH holders that don't feel comfortable locking their ETH in a DAO, but if you end up having significantly more collateral accessible but just not locked in, doesn't that screw with the numbers?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I think that that's broadly the right instinct Matthew. One thing that I would say is volatility versus just absolute level is an important thing. So, what I think is a big driver of collateralization ratio is yes, the absolute ETH price, but also the volatility of ETH and so essentially, when we see ETH being very volatile, we tend to see a corresponding relative increase in collateralization ratio. When we see ETH prices are high, just based on simple math, we see an absolute increase in collateralization ratio and one of the different \[crosstalk 01:05:13\] -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

But, if the deposits of ETH are running parallel, so the actual count, if it goes up a thousand percent or ... yeah, it goes up a thousand percent in price, then, if you have a thousand percent increase in deposits into the PETH pool then they should be almost one to one.

I think that's gonna be ... the blow back would be fantastic, so, we're committed to this system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Then we start ramping up some of the options that I wanna keep on exploring in the MKRgov link, do we have thresholding? So, for the poll, that is twenty percent of all maker need to show up before that poll is valid or does one of the poll options need to be twenty five percent higher than the second best option? I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It seems like that could potentially be an option as well, but I think that the course is set now and changing that would sort of create a crisis of confidence in the way that we have governance at MakerDAO, to not do it because we don't like it.

So, I guess one of the questions would be what if it doesn't after ... let's imagine, you know, just you know, very theoretical that it doesn't hit that enough votes of the three percent stability fee increase, what point does it actually activate is kind of my general question and then if it doesn't hit that, but we yet hit another poll a week later, is that what you're saying would be the window where we'd kind of stand down?

My expectation is we spend the next week, just aggregating opinions and then, in the next call, we have a clearer picture of which way the community is leaning as far as solving this problem and whether it really is a problem. Look, there's all kinds of things on the table, the other one that we just kind of came up with as the call was proceeding is like is the polling architecture a bad match when it comes to determining what a risk parameter should look like. Maybe that's just ... maybe polling is for intention or business changes or foundation changes and executive votes are simply ... I mean, we go straightly into an executive vote for a parameter change, I'm not entirely sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Unfortunately I lost track of the questions in the side bar, so I'm wondering if things got missed there. But, I think that also leads back into this idea that I'm very, very, very hesitant to allow these meetings to be a decision making forum, I don't want ... we've already seen this misunderstanding in the community where people have referenced these calls as the governance committee and that's kind of antithetical to the entire thing that we're trying to achieve here. This isn't where important people gather to make decisions for the rest of the ecosystem, it's where people with deep insight get together, ask some really cool questions and then return that back to the wider group for decision making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Alright, thanks everybody. I'll say it five times. Continue the discussion in the MKRgov, I'll be posting a summary there, I'll be posting a bunch of links, I'll be posting links to Primoz's spreadsheets and Vishesh's graphs and video, audio and transcripts as well, so, let's continue the discussion.
