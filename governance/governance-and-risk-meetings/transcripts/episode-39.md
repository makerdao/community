Welcome to the June 13th edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of community developments at MakerDAO. We'll be hearing from Cyrus Younessi the head of Risk. What is your title Cyrus? How embarrassing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Cyrus Younessi, the head of risk, will be walking us through collateral risk today. I'm not going to steal his thunder. I'll let him get into that. I have some things that I'd like to say at the top of the call though. I want to make sure that people are as engaged as we can possibly incite them to be in these meetings. So, in the group chats, I've posted a link to a reddit thread. In that reddit thread, every week, we post a summary of the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

He also provides links to timestamps in the YouTube video, so it's easy for people to get catch up, get caught up with what's been going on. In that thread, we continue the discussion for the rest of the weea k and this is meme I keep on hitting over and over and over again. But it's worth doing, so I'm going to keep on doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

But we don't make decisions here, whenever possible, I guess. Then we continue the debate in mediums that have a longer life cycle, or lifespan, than these one hour calls in North American friendly time zones. And currently, that's Reddit. If we surface some important issues, get into reddit, that reddit thread, debate with us. We'll come up with some conclusions, test the temperature of the community and see how things move on from there.                                                                                                                                                                          |

In the interim, continue the debate there. Preamble number two, we are extremely interested in hearing everybody's opinion in these calls. We have a lot of really smart people here. These calls aren't designed to be me, Cyrus, Vishesh talking. They're designed for us to talk and moderate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If they have a microphone, feel free. If you have a microphone, feel free to jump in and ask a question whenever you like. Interrupt us, it's not a problem. If you don't have a microphone, you're supposed to be working, you're in a cubby somewhere, type your question into a chat and one of us will get to that during the course of the call and we'll ask it for you. We also have been having a sort of extended Q&A session at the end of these calls.                                                                                                                                                   |

So if you're interested, or you have some kind of of the wall question, wait till the end and we'll get to it at that point. I think that I'm going to leave it there. It feels like I'm forgetting one of my favorite preambles, but I'm not sure what that is right now, so I'll skip it. Let's talk about governance for a second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [#](#000328) / [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h03m28s) | Richard Brown      | We're seeing some interesting things beginning to happen in the world of governance. And that interesting thing that I want to talk about is something that makes me happy, I guess and this is cool. We're seeing some rational behavior with the voters, which is nice. Governance is a new thing in this space, and it looks a new thing to the internet in general I guess. But it's even newer for crypto we're all trying to figure out how governance works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [#](#000357) / [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h03m57s) | Richard Brown      | I like to tell people or whenever I get the opportunity that governance is a capital H, hard problem. Nobody has the solution. Algorithms will not save us. It's ultimately about people and communication and sociology, more than it is about game theory. But I guess there's an overlap; you know what I'm talking about. One of the things that we've seen over the last couple of weeks is some encouragingly rational behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [#](#000425) / [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h04m25s) | Richard Brown      | It's my impression and I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but it's my impression that the voters are fairly engaged with the data coming out of these calls. And my impression of that is coming from the fact that, during the polling process, the stake weight is being applied in a conservative manner. And it seems like right now the team or the MKR voters are testing the limits of the lower bound of the stability fee that still maintains the peg, which is very encouraging … ze've been hovering around the midpoint of the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [#](#000508) / [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h05m08s) | Richard Brown      | So, we've been hovering around the point where we stay where we're at. There's been this mild competition, between voters staking 1% lower than the current stability fee, and a more conservative set of voters seemingly preferring the current stability fee. And in my mind that's an encouraging behavior. If things had gone of the rails, we would see stakeholders with conflicting incentives, attempting to skew the stability fee in ways that might benefit them most, and we're not seeing that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [#](#000543) / [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h05m43s) | Richard Brown      | So, the priority still seems to be maintenance of the peg, which is what we're all here to ensure. That makes me super happy. I like the … I'm known for my optimism, so I like to start things off with some good news. Second thing I want to talk about is something that's far more murky and far more complex. And we've been wrestling with this in these calls for weeks now. I keep on asking that question without presenting an answer, because they don't have a clear answer in the sense I ask them from the community.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [#](#000616) / [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h06m16s) | Richard Brown      | So here's the issue. We have a governance system that's basic but works. It's basic because we're as a group, as a foundation unwilling to experiment with governance, because this is serious business what we're doing here. We can't really be playing games with this situation or testing out new technologies. We don't understand how that works. We have a very basic polling system. We have very basic governance system, voting system. We poll for signals. We take that signal; we add it to an executive vote. We wait to see if people think that vote is good or not.                                                                                                                                            |
| [#](#000655) / [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h06m55s) | Richard Brown      | And then when the community moves in that direction, we implement those changes to the system. It works. It's great. Actually this is another thing that I'm going to bring up and this is the dangers of the new normal. And it's moving into a system and then assuming that's the way the world's going to work. And an example of that was we had, the peg had deviated. We were locked at 0.95, 0.96 for a long time. We raised the stability fee. We needed it to be responsive and agile in order to do that. That required a weekly cadence of votes.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [#](#000731) / [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h07m31s) | Richard Brown      | And so every week, we all got together in this forum. We hash things out. Polls were put into the voting mechanism, the community voted. Happily we're in a situation for the last three or four weeks where the peg is healthy. The voters have signals, last two weeks. And this is another great signal is that they prefer not to change the stability fee at all. So we're still looking at 16.5 for this week. So that raises the question, is this new normal, the one that we want to be stuck in? Do we need to vote every week?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [#](#000803) / [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h08m03s) | Richard Brown      | And I think that that's a question that needs to be answered. And we need to figure out how to answer that. So that runs us up against this next conundrum that we have where, in the current voting system that we're presented with, we can only have one poll at a time, even more restrictive, even though we actually have one vote. So, you can vote on a pole. You can stake your Maker into a poll; you can stake it into a vote but not both. We can't have more than one poll at this point. These issues are all going to be solved in the coming weeks, with a new version of the portal that we're affectionately calling 1.5.                                                                                      |

But the question, I would like this group to begin debating and thinking about and then finishing that debate in the reddit thread is, we're seeing stability right now because this is the second week in a row that we have not chosen to move the stability fee. Has this given enough breathing room to consider that next week, we don't have a poll for the stability fee at all? Next week we have a poll that is related to cadence. So next week, do we pull for a, should we be voting every week or should we be voting every two weeks?                                                                                                                           |

We can only have one poll as I previously discussed, but here's the answers that, the questions that I want answers to. How often should we be voting and what are the steps in that vote? So, do we vote every week? Do we vote every two weeks? Do we vote in increments of 1% for the stability fee? Do we vote in increments of 2%? I think that we can formulate questions that answer, that cover all those options with a single poll.                                                                                                                                                                      |

And then next week we assume that we're just not going to move the stability fee at all. We're going to devote next week to figuring out what the proper cadence is. The issues, the larger issues at play here are questions around apathy and friction and engagement levels, that the community needs to consider.

If, we are voting every week and there's no urgency to that vote, people began to drop off and potentially the security of the system begins to drop off as well. And so these are questions that we all need to answer. We need to hash this stuff out. I don't know how to do that. And let me finish this off with some cautions. I'm a highly skeptical about the notion of rough consensus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

But I could recap it for you. A rough consensus is generally a matter of perception. So, whoever thinks they got rough consensus and whatever forum they happened to have been conversing in and the strength of their opinion generally decides what rough consensus was. You can have 20 different people come out of the same call with different ideas of what a rough consensus is. The reason why we have a polling system is so we don't need to rely on rough consensus. So here's the conundrum. How do we get enough consensus to alter the polling system when the polling system is a thing that we use to get consensus? |

But, I'll just ask a question I guess on this topic. It may not be Makers responsibility and I understand it's a huge problem to solve, but like voting delegation is not Makers responsibility, but it is Makers problem. I think in the sense that, it has a big impact on how governance goes down, the level of engagement, which ultimately impacts the types of outcomes that are achieved in this process, which impacts monetary policy and thus impacts the system.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Let me jump in there because I was not, I usually like to be precise with my language, and I was not being precise. When I say responsibility what I meant was, for us to develop and implement and then release. I'm not sure that that's the case. And I should caveat, this is all my opinion. I don't run MakerDAO. You'd be amazed at the lack of control I have over the greater world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And we're not really looking at like debt ceilings or liquidation ratios and new collateral types and all that kind of stuff. I imagine engagement will pick up significantly once there's kind of more on the line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So let me organize my thoughts here. So, here's the issues that ultimately we, there's this impression that we're not seeing it as enough Maker getting staked as we would like. We're not seeing enough individual voters turn out as we'd like. But this is a systemic issue with crypto in general.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I hear nothing but good things about Decred. And there's a couple other examples of that, but …                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So what is the incentive for all of these people to come out of the woodwork and vote on something that doesn't need to be voted on from their perspective?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If we keep on iterating, as long as the engagement numbers go up over month, over month and we're on the right path, I think. And whether people are apathetic right now, because we lack of delegate solution or whether they're apathetic right now, because they just don't see any point to voting at all because the peg is stable, people are already voting for the thing that they wanted to vote for, so what's the point?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So we're going to sort of take a step back and go through the collateral risk lifecycle from start to finish. So it should hopefully be a little bit less erratic and less frantic. This is kind of the general process of how this would work. Start off with the onboarding collateral, which is basically how do we ingest new collateral types into the system, followed by a due diligence or fundamental evaluation, from which the results get put into the quantitative model, along with all the trading and market data.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And then, I think after we go through those, we can start talking about actual … I think by that point we'll be at the stage, where we're going to start talking about specific collateral types and how we're going to be evaluating them. So this is obviously not an outline just for today, because there's a lot of stuff here. I think today we're just going to talk about the due diligence section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So sometime in the next couple of weeks, I think that should be coming out and then we can talk about it. In terms of schedule, I'm just tentatively guessing. We can probably run through due diligence today, maybe not all the way. Maybe there is a bit of leftover, and then we can talk about the meaty quant stuff for two, three, four weeks. Not really sure how long that's going to take.                                                                                                                                        |

Final point, this is the one diagram in today's presentation, so soak it up because these things take a long time. Okay. So just really quickly on the onboarding application, I'm not going to spend too much time on this because as I said, it's coming out soon. But essentially what this consists of is a technical audit, which is essentially an evaluation of the contract code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

There's a risk audit where we kind of basically just try to figure out if this is a complete scam or not, or is something even worth considering? Essentially we can envision a situation where we have hundreds of potential collateral types in the queue, and we need to find a way to filter and prioritize these collateral types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In some cases we might need to do counterparty audit, just kind of looking especially for security tokens, looking at who the issuer is and that kind of stuff. As I mentioned, this is just kind of a filtration mechanism, where we can prioritize the incoming collaterals so that we can just start tackling them one by one. And there are also some interesting governance implications here, in the sense that how exactly, does potential collateral even get selected for evaluation.                                                                                                                                                                              |

And this is really the meat of today's presentation. Talk a little about the goals, how the analysis works and a scoring framework. Okay. So our main goals for looking at a qualitative assessment for collateral first is ,we want to find risks that are not immediately present in the trading history. So, we want to look for aspects of the collateral that might contribute to a CDP liquidation that we reveal through a deep dive into the organization.

Bad is relative to the specific parameter you're talking about. So, if you're talking about revenues, yes, liquidations produce penalties which produces fees, but also if you're talking about liquidations above a certain size or a certain frequency, then you get into an additional concern when ETH is 3 or 5% of the Maker, like when three or 5% of ETH is locked up in Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It should be clear that there are certain aspects of collateral type that could lead to very bad situation, for MakerDAO that we'd want to evaluate from qualitative perspective. And, I'll get into examples in a bit. Okay. So kind of mentioned, kind of touched upon this last week, a process for how to actually begin evaluation collateral. My first step is always a classification. Broadly we have bearer assets and registered assets or security tokens.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

There's essentially no counterparty risk. And big question I get a lot is obviously around wrapped tokens, wrapped Bitcoin and all the others that might come down the line. And essentially wrapped tokens are a form of registered or security tokens, because there is that counterparty risk which has to be evaluated. So essentially, that counterparty risk is an example of the recourse analysis that needs to be done.                                                                                                                                                                   |

Now, it needs to be very carefully studied. You need to study the issuer. In this case it'd be Bitco, but whoever it might be, we're going to have to look at all these in detail. And it should be obvious that the downside here is if for whatever reason, you cannot claim your underlying asset from the wrapped token then well, essentially you won't have anybody bidding on that collateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And really the importance of this division is mainly that, we don't have to do too much of a recourse analysis. No one in single collateral has ever thought about the liquidation process for ETH, because everybody knows that as soon as you purchased ETH through the auction, it just directly gets transferred to your wallet. In certain situations that may not be the case and we need to be cognizant of that.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Everybody wants to just have ETH only or whatever. But, obviously there's an extremely high correlation between lots of the current ERC20 tokens. Okay.

And these base layer tokens or are typically subdivided into money candidates or non-money candidates. So obviously Bitcoin wants to be this kind of global cash. ETH potentially also wants to do the same thing, but then you also have base layer tokens that are, kind of self-described themselves as not competing for that market.                                                                                                                                      |

Utility tokens, I think everybody here generally knows what utility tokens, are a special token that you'd use for particular service.

So, when it comes to the security tokens, really all you're doing is making a counterparty risk adjustment to your risk model. So if you had Ether versus wrapped Ether that was issued by some centralized custodian, then you'd to just factor in the counterparty risk, which is obviously a big question on how to actually do that. We'll get to it soon.

But if you want to do valuation models, there's some funky ways to do it with these, with the bearer assets. For example, if you've ever looked at what a Bitcoin valuation model looks like, with security tokens it's fairly easy. You can just borrow from the traditional world of how a lot of these assets are evaluated. So at this point, we should have a understanding of what this token is, what it's worth and all that.                                                                                                                                                                               |

So all assets have risks to them, right? And it's our job to reveal what those risks are. Now with traditional assets like equities, bonds, whatever, I think the risks are not fairly understood but extremely well understood. Not really the case with crypto assets. I think a lot of people don't necessarily have the right intuition for what gives these assets value in the first place, and so they are somewhat unaware of the risks associated with them as well.                                                                                                                                                                     |

And store value is very, is a very mean based value proposition. And as soon as that thing gains momentum one way or another, it really just runs with it. Simple example with Ether in 2017, when ETH was the only money acceptable for ICOs. Everybody needed it to get into these projects. And then when ICOs died, people realized that they didn't need this money any more.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For utility tokens, we have what are known as velocity risks, where people just kind of trade, where people don't hold onto the asset for any meaningful amount of time.

Because in some respects utility tokens, to be honest, don't really have much of a value proposition at all. Yet there are still many that persist in the wild, and so we can start to discuss why that is the case. And in particular, branding tends to be a big driver in my mind.

And that's going to spit out a score that will then go into the more broader quantitative model that calculates aspects like the last distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

After you have an idea for what it's worth, then you can look at what are the risks to it not being worth what you think it might be. So for example, some of these risks are quite low probability. And for example, I think the fork risk of work tokens is quite low personally. But it will all get factored in. Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Really anyone, any risk team or anyone in the community, who is really excited to see any collateral be put into the system, has to approach it from the mindset of, what is the worst thing that can happen? How bad can this get? How bad can MakerDAO holders suffer? And this can happen in a lot of different ways. Recourse analysis, very simple example, and I've used this a lot but what is the chance that you don't recover your dollars from tether?                                                                                                                                                 |

This is basically where people call MakerDAO the TCR of crypto or similar to some sort of rating agency, because the grade or the score that we assign to collateral types is what we use to, evaluate the more quantitative risk parameters such as the stability fee. Details of this framework, I guess we can go over another time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

They don't necessarily map to a direct stability fee, like seven out of 10 is 5% or whatever, although you could in some ways. So let me just do a couple of quick examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So for example for Ether, obviously we're going to have to redo Ether's collateral type for MCD, and we might as well kind of apply this new framework and try to come up with the most optimal risk rating and risk parameters. So ETH would come down the pipeline somehow and then we do a technical audit. Ethereum has been audited a couple of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A financial audit would probably look at supply, it's inflation, the team, just very high level. And then we'll say, “Okay, Ether just looks good enough to be evaluated more in depth.” So we'll kind of look at, what Ether the token actually looks like. It's base player token, we know what it does. We evaluate it from a fundamental perspective. Look at some of the risks, and then we give it a score, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And then the score is what gets transferred to the quantitative model, which we'll talk about next week. Another quick example of utility token, same thing. And then the last thing I want to emphasize is just, is the philosophy here. I think we're going to be seeing a lot of conservatism, common sense. I don't want to rush to do anything we're not comfortable with. Pretty standard stuff, but it's good to give people a reminder that we are, I think the goal should be to take this nice and easy and do it properly.                                                                                                                    |

Then there was the other question of, if there is going to be shitcoin voted in, how do we vote it out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

One method would be to just lower the debt ceiling. There's a couple of different ways to do it with varying degrees of urgency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For example, if Ethereum has some major scaling breakthrough, that works, everybody loves it, then actually it's lower risk than it was before. So yeah, you can definitely track these and adjust the scoring, adjust the ratings over time. Companies have their risk ratings adjusted over time as well, so it's the same concept.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So, just to jump in, things for the past week plus as has been noted were fairly stable. What's interesting is in the last just 24 hours, ETH jumped up a little bit and people levered up a little bit more on that, which depressed the DAI price a little bit. And so I think this is a topic to consider for the governance votes, which is, you can see over time since the 19.5% stability fee increase, there was this dwindling of peaks and valleys to a little bit more of a stable level.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And so I think we're starting to see some increased variability in DAI price, particularly the amount of DAI that trades below a dollar. And so I'll dive into that a little bit more in a different graph, it's easier to see. But trading volume has shrank over the past two weeks and then spiked up again last night. So that's just something to keep an eye on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Either a lot of ETH being sold for DAI when people are cashing out on leverage or far more often people buying, no sorry, selling DAI in order to leverage further up on ETH. And based on what's been going on with some of the secondary lending rates in the past 24 hours or so, I think that was more of the latter where people were levering up in anticipation of a bit of a jump in ETH price, which actually self-fulfilled within a 24 hour timescale.                                                                                                                                                                           |

So as we've noted since mid-April, start of May, the trend in DAI price and ETH price has kind of tracked. I think we're starting to see a little bit of divergence from that, but it's a little bit too soon to say. So in my analysis, the view would be that that tracking was actually a reversal of a previous trend, where people were levering heavily up on DAI and just kind of continually accumulating the amount of ETH leverage that they bought with their DAI.                                                                                                                                                                   |

Then at the start of May, ETH price had started to run up, some people cashed out and delevered a bit. As ETH price came down into kind of the 230-ish range, we started to see people get a little bit more excited and lever up further. And so that's kind of like the narrative there is, initially there was this huge levering up, then unwinding a bit and now people are starting to pick back up again a little. To talk about what that means for supplies.                                                                                                                                                   |

Even this kind of cuts off with a 24 hour delay, it's now around 83 million. So, essentially as the stability fee is continually increasing from 11.5 to 19.5%, there was a pretty steady drop in supply. That stayed stagnant all through the 17.5% decrease, but then around the 16.5% decrease, that started to tick back up a little bit. And has now come up a little bit further, but that's probably a short term effect from what's been going on with ETH price.                                                                                                                                                   |

Like I said, I think time is what generally tells us that. So, as we look at more of these like long run averages I think will get clearer pictures. But, my initial sense is with the 17.5% decrease, there wasn't a huge effect. But with the 16.5% decrease, there has been a little bit of a ticking up in the DIA supply and the amount of leverage that people have been seeking.                                                                                                                                                                              |

It's also been on these secondary lending platforms, which is a topic that we've kind of touched on. So, I'll circle back to that in a minute. In terms of circulation of debt, this trend has been very clear as opposed to others where it's harder to … Sorry all the data just to reload it as we were talking. So I have to reset afresh. But in terms of the circulation of debt, the trend was fairly clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Once we hit that 19.5% mark, there started to be a legitimate impact where that debt started to come down significantly. And so in that sense, the circulation of debt started to increase and debt was getting younger. What is interesting is that also coincided with this increased traction on secondary lending platforms. So part of it, I think it's good to consider the effects of refinancing.                                                                                                                                            |

And this is despite the fact that in the same time range dYdX and Compound v2 we're sort of getting this renewed traction. So I think that speaks volumes to me in the sense that, 16.5% seems to be a meaningful level, and might be either a balanced point or slightly too low, very hard to say the difference between those two. But, I think there are noticeable effects where it was different than 17.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So, although, and I don't have this graph to show you here today, the amount of unique users that have been interacting with CDPs has continually increased, which is a good metric in terms of usership and traction.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So what that means to me is that over time, a larger portion of the debt is being drawn out from existing CDPs, even though there may be more a new individual users interacting with the contract. Collateralization, so was … collateralization was one of the more … Sorry, that keeps happening. One of the more interesting metrics in the past couple of days.                                                                                                                                      |
| [#](#010756) / [01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=01h07m56s) | Vishesh Choudhry   | So, we saw this huge run up in collateralization percentage after April. I think that was a hesitancy for people to make significant changes to their collateral despite the rise in ETH price. So, essentially as ETH popped up, people were scared that it might come back down, and so they didn't make significant changes to their CDPs. As ETH sustained those levels, and it actually started to come down a little bit, people started to clear out some of their debt, and also clear out some of their collateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

What's interesting is that again it's ticked up a little bit, in the past 24 hours and it's actually even higher than 470 now. So, again, I think it's just this valley has started to be hit around 16.5%. In terms of the attractiveness of leverage even at like ETH 230 to 250 price range. To just touch on DAI price real quick. So, kind of reflecting what I've been saying, there's been this widened spread, in terms of DAI prices and where DAI is created.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Now, I think there was this huge reaction that, “Oh, once DAI if hit that dollar one, dollar two range everything was okay,” which I think was broadly the sense. But then people started to decrease that stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

So I think perhaps these are indicators that 16.5% is slightly too low or maybe just right and this is a short-term effect. There's again, no real way to tell the difference between those two things. So this is some of these secondary lending platform trading volume or activity outstanding volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But in the past couple of weeks, that's actually held fairly steady. And then in the past 24 hours, that actually came down a little bit. But it was both borrow and supply that came down, even though the overall DAI supply ticked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So to be clear, the upper tail 100%, if you look at like Coinbase for example, that price, the ETH/DAI price does tend to stay centered closer around a dollar. Actually, this is somewhat uncharacteristic. I think this is an effect of some of the frenzy that happened in the last 24 hours, where you see more of this Oasis long tail towards the lower prices. Usually it's actually Uniswap that tends to dominate the lower tail prices, primarily due to slippage I'm assuming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And so, to your point Cyrus, if I understand your point correctly, yes, most of the mainstream trading sources do tend to sit around a dollar. The lower tail of dye prices is usually the one that's in the liquidity crunch and they need to get quick access, primarily because they're trying to refinance or they're trying to lever up and they don't want to miss that jump in the ETH price.

I don't want to call it a collateral type, but really the package, because it's not only if it's ETH, it's ETH with whatever collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, liquidation ratio of all of those things that you mentioned before about, they can all be different and can change.                                                                                                                                                                           |

I'll have to discount them and let's just ignore them for the time being. That there's a natural tradeoff between the DSR and the risk premium that gets associated with that collateral package, one that's somewhat inverse, where you're taking the DSR, which is a riskless … excluding technology risk.                                                                                                                            |

So, as we assume the way they risk free asset, the percentage of a given allocation to a DSR compared to the value of risk component is inverse. The more we see the further you to the right, the less percentage that goes to a DSR, which somewhat leads to the logic that, as assets become more risky, the percentages flip. It's the same graph but in a different interpretation, right? So the logic of this being just then over time, depending on what assets we put together and the DSR being a common event, it ultimately creates …                                                                                                                                                                        |

What we ultimately need to compute using algorithms PID or not, is what percentage … excuse me, not what percentage, but the sum of those two things.

You know what you're buying and you know what the percentages are. Then the question is, how much do we move it around as we try to find the optimal methods. But the point I'm trying to get at is, we have a scenario where we take one asset that's not risky, a US treasury and an asset that is let's say riskier, Ether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I don't have a defined, rigid viewpoint, but this is just my perspective right now. So anyone who mints DAI, whether it'd be from a super safe treasury, whatever, or from a super risky asset, like Ether, when they create the DAI, they immediately or semi-immediately pass it off to someone else, some third party, some counter party, whomever is their recipient, right? The counterparty of that margin trade or whatever.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

However you want to think about it, the DSR is a rate applied that is for the benefit of the counterparty for that leverage trade. Now, it's not entirely clear to me why the recipient of the counterparty of the DAI created from a treasury collateral would require a different compensation rate from the recipient of this DAI trade.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So like if we ultimately … Let's just take ETH for a second. That's the case example just. Forget we have a treasury all together.

And then in both of them, the DSR as well as the VaR for just Ether will find themselves to be compressed and fall back down over time. But while it's sitting at five or six or 7% of the DSR, you absolutely obliterate your ability to ever launch any type of lower risk asset, because the DSR, plus that risk premium is way outside the market because it's way outside the aggregate risks that's tolerable.                                                     |

What I'm trying to get at is that market forces, the ultimate stability key that an asset class comes together. If we ultimately have the underlying DSR too high, because we're not properly allocating the risk, it's not that Maker won't choose to, the market will dictate. For example, just as a base case, if we ever want to put on treasuries onto this system, but the DSR is 5%, there's no use case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And Matthews, I got to probably reread your posts if you go through the math of it, because the way you described that equation started to help me understand, but I still just kind of see the credit premium on all of these various collateral types being exactly that, the premium based on the actual risk of the asset. And then the DSR is really just what goes up and down in response to monetary policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The point I'm trying to bring up is not that this concept should be applied to any aspect of the risk in my respectful opinion, needs to make those decisions about how risky a given collateral package is, with all of its characteristics and define it, plot it and set it. And if we decide later we don't like it, then we need to drop the debt ceiling or let it organically die off and replace it in another structure that's more or less risky based on the conditions on the ground.                                                                                                                                                        |

Vishesh, to answer your question about parameters really quickly, who can change them or how often? Who is obviously MKR holders change them. How often, cadent to something that we have to figure out eventually. What parameters can I think? Any parameter. The subject to be changed … and what do you mean by, does that model converged to MCD?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It's a more stable system. Could theoretically be that the answer to the most stable system in that scenario is just one single collateral type that is like relatively well trusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
