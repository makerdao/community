Welcome to the September 51th edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of community development at MakerDAO. In these calls, we are enormously interested in everything that the community has to say, particularly people that are willing to come up to these calls. So if you have a question or a comment, please, please, please, please, I'm begging you, type it in the chat at the side or wherever your UI happens to have placed it. Or if you have access to a microphone, please do not feel shy about getting on the mic and interrupting us. We interrupt each other all the time. There's no reason why the community should not do it, as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Historically, these meetings have been about governance and then they were about governance and risk. And soon, they are going to be about governance, risk, and oracles. And soon after that, they're going to be other things, as well. We are going to be having some conversations about how to optimize these calls, how to break them up, how to organize them. I'm hesitant to do that up front, because I'm sure that we've all had the same experience where trying to pre-plan your Slack meeting room organization long before you have enough reason to fill up those rooms is fraught with peril. I don't want to fragment these calls before we know that it's time to fragment them. But some time in the future, we might be splitting these [inaudible 00:01:37]. In the meantime, though, it's going to be action packed. And these calls are going to have a lot more variety than we had in the future, which might be nice. It might be overwhelming. We'll see how it goes.                                                                                                                                                                     |

So Nik, our head of back-end services, is going to tell us about how we're going to deal with oracles in the future in sort of open-sourcy, governance world that we live in now. Looking forward to that. We're going to hear from Vishesh. He's going to tell us about the state of the peg. And then depending on interest and time, we'll stick around for a half hour or so and just answer some general Q&A or do some general Q&A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I don't know if I'm using that correctly, but this is a scientific governance and risk call. Very rarely do we actually talk about the polls and the results in the polls in governance, and we should probably start doing that. Recently, the community has signaled its intention and actually acted on its intention to lower the stability fee, which is a very interesting and encouraging behavior that Maker holders are not viciously self-interested people that are trying to scrape every last fee of the system. We're actually all enormously interested in maintaining stability of the peg. And if that means the stability fee needs to go down, it needs to go down. And the community jumped on that on our last vote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I'm not a financial analyst. When it comes to crypto, I barely know what I'm doing, at least when it comes to watching charts. But it seems to have been presient because the peg was over a dollar and got even more of a deviation there in the last couple days. And who knows why? Maybe Vishesh will tell us. And so I won't steal his thunder and he can explain all of that to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I sort of dramatically refer to them as watershed moments in the history of MakerDAO governance. Maybe that was a bit too much. But we are on a long road to decentralization. And the way that that works is we need to bootstrap systems and positions, rolls, responsibilities, processes in the ecosystem, and fund those positions and rolls and processes and the creation of those things. And then eventually, hand these things off to the community. The first role that we had with that model were the risk teams, obviously. The second role with that model is the governance facilitator, which is essentially what I've been doing in these calls for the last 51 meetings. And the next one up to bat is the oracle teams. We need to expose some levers there and some responsibilities to the governance ecosystem for eventual decentralization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Over time, once these roles have been nailed down and processes are in place, actors from the ecosystem hopefully will arrive and they will begin to assume some of these responsibilities. For example, the governance facilitator essentially is me. In a very near future ... I shouldn't say very. Who knows what that actually even looks like. But post MCD, the next six to twelve months, who knows? It would be absolutely stellar if there was two or three other governance facilitators that could work with me and more governance facilitators, and then I can back away from the system completely and then the community could take over. There's all kind of information about that in the governance facilitator mandate in the forums. Oh, I'm sure everybody in this call are reading through those forums daily, so I'm sure I don't need to remind you. But if you're interested in the mandate, please have a look at the forum threads.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Cyrus' risk team mandate has 100% support from the community from 29 voters. I am not doing as well, unfortunately. I'm a 99.something% because somebody, and whoever this is I absolutely adore them, somebody spent \$20 in Maker to vote no for my mandate. And whoever you are, I like your style. I think that might be it for what I wanted to talk about today. LongForWisdom, I'm going to hand it off to you and you can give us a recap of what's been happening in the governance ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So we've got a couple of fairly big discussion threads pop up this week, specifically around vote delegation and what looks like the soon introduction of MKR as Compound collateral. So these two threads specifically, I've had quite a lot of discussion on. I've heard a lot of good points back on forth on the vote delegation. A lot of people are obviously very pro, but we had a couple of people coming out with out against it, as well, which is good.

And there's an overlap here with delegation and Compound in that the DeFi ecosystem or crypto space, in general, is different than the traditional financial world, which may come as a surprise to people in this group. The thing that I find most interesting, though, is that in the traditional world, there's checks and balances and laws and regulations and rules and all kinds of guardrails and sandboxes and velvet ropes. In the tech world, if you've build something and put it on the internet, you're expected to defend that thing against the ecosystem that you've released it into. There's this interesting overlap with how DeFi, in the crypto space, is emerging. And it's coming from a technical perspective as opposed to a traditional finance perspective. And there's the assumption in the IT world that when you put something on the internet, it's your responsibility ... you assume that there's bad actors that will attempt to manipulate it and it's your responsibility to make that system robust enough to withstand those attacks.                                                                                                             |

And I think that these are interesting conversations that need to be had. We can't stop anybody else in the ecosystem from doing whatever they wish to do, because that's what it's all about. But it'll be our responsibility to figure out how we deal with those things and that means, do we attempt to block activities or features that we don't like? Or do we attempt to get ahead of those features and activities? Do we attempt to mitigate those damages? There's lots of different ways to approach these things and that's part of the same conversation we've had with the delegation thing and with the [inaudible 00:10:14] thing. Some people came up with ideas of how do we stop, or how do we make it hard for both delegation and lending and borrowing of governance? I think that it will be very cool to see how that shakes up. I'm hoping that we decide that we need to make our systems more robust in order to support the rest of the ecosystem that's popping up around us.                                                                                                     |

So that was sort of spurred because I'm working on some video content. Our overarching goal is to bring more people in and to obviously feel better about the consensus that we're getting. It really occurred to me that it's like a fork in the road a little bit, as far as strategy goes, about whether we're focusing on the total amount of Maker versus the total amount of people. And I think we should continue that conversation, but I also think we should note that it's fine if we say both strategies are important. The thing is, they're two diverging sets of tactics. So the same tactics wouldn't necessarily apply to getting the top 50 whales versus to getting a thousand Maker holders, period. And that's really what I was trying to get at there. So if we do continue in sort of this deadlock fashion, I think that's actually great because it means that we realize that both of those sides are important and we just need different sets of tactics for each side, which I'm going to continue to work on as far as video content and social media goes.                                                                                                                                         |

I think that we have to be cautious about thinking and [inaudible 00:12:54] that we're living in a binary world. The way that the system is designed is to get people as much skin in the game, incentive to manage the system in order to protect them. So with that model in mind, we should be trying to get more whales into the system, but we're up against human nature here. It's actually human nature, but everybody wants underdog to win or they're looking at the voting system and they say, "Voting equals representative democracy," and so there's this dichotomy that people need to work through. But you're right. Personally, I like to see both. I like to see thousands of curls and minnows and ... I can't remember what the scale is ... to attempt to offset the whales in the system to spice things up a bit, I guess. Get a bit of variety in there. But it also shows us an interesting metric that I'm super keen on, which is do we see different voting behaviors based on the amounts of Maker that people possess. So are large holders voting differently than small holders? And that's something that we should understand if that's the case.                                                       |

So for those of you who don't know, oracles are the way in which the DAI system is able to get prices of the collateral assets. So why is this useful? We need to know if positions are sufficiently collateralized. And if they're not, then they can be liquidated. We need to know currently in the system, when we liquidate collateral, we liquidate it at a 3% discount to the spot price. The spot price has to come from somewhere and it comes from these oracles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We kind of think that it's time that that's changed. Governance has definitely come a long way over the past year or so. You guys have shown me successfully that you've been able to hold the peg and kind of had this drive to organize yourselves. And it seems to be working really well. So it's time to throw some more stuff at you. And so part of making the oracles more decentralized is to make sure that, instead of us being kind of in the driver's seat and making all the decisions, that it's actually you guys who make all the decisions. So this is really about handing over the keys to you guys and just making you aware of what these new responsibilities are and what you're in for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So it's similar to the general governance framework in that it defines these set of processes for how governance should run. Well, the oracle governance framework is this blueprint of the responsibilities, with respect to oracles, that have been placed on governance and kind of the processes around how we go to fill those responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Well, first of all, I want to say that the oracle governance framework is a living document. These processes not only can be changed, but they will be changed. We're going to see what works, what doesn't work. We're going to realize that there's entire new areas of responsibility that we didn't even think about, that we need to address at some point. So this is supposed to be a starting point. We need to start somewhere. So there's going to be more responsibilities and more fine-grained stuff in the actual proposal when I publish it to the forum next week, but I just want to take a high-level overview of it real quick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Now that terminology might seem a bit foreign to some of you. So what is the difference between a feed and an oracle? Well, feed is an individual who is running a bot that is pushing price updates for an asset, versus the oracle is the actual smart contract onchain that other smart contracts can query for the price. So when you basically group together a set of feeds, the onchain price that you see in the oracle is actually the median of all of those feed inputs. That means that we're placing a lot of trust in feeds to be good actors and not ... They have the ability to launch an oracle attack, which would be catastrophic. I'm sure I don't have to tell you. So we need to have strict criteria for defining what makes a good feed. Who would be a good feed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So for example, one of them is the sensitivity parameter. And this is basically, what percent spread do you want to have before you update the oracle? If you, say, have a 2% sensitivity, then if the price changes 1%, then the oracle price will not change. It's going to wait for that threshold. The lower you have the sensitivity, the more, quote-on-quote, "sensitive," your oracle will be to prices changes. However, it also gets very expensive because you're doing updates more often, more often, more often, more often and each of those are consuming gas costs, it can add up very quick, especially when the network is congested and all of a sudden you have 60 Gwei transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Another one we have is the delay. So in MCD, the oracle value is fed into a smart contract called the oracle security module. And the oracle security module is there to protect MCD from oracle attacks. So it acts as kind of the buffer in between the oracle and the MCD system. And the way that it acts as this buffer is that it has a delay. So let's say the delay is one hour, right? If there's a new oracle price pushed, then the MCD system waits one hour before it actually uses that price and that gives it time to react to an oracle attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So if you have a certain number of feeds, how many feeds together is enough to achieve quorum, is enough to achieve a price change? Is it one feed? It is ten feeds? Is it 50 feeds? Is it all of the feeds? Is it 70% of the feeds? Is it 51% of the feeds? There are other parameters as well, but these are all kind of the main parameters that governance is going to be responsible for.

So the second thing I want to talk about is that you're not alone. So before we had this governance handover of oracles, I said that the foundation had been doing all of these things behind the scenes. So it's been myself, maybe you guys have heard of Mariano, Mariano Conti, and a handful of other people who have been really instrumental in making sure that this all runs to perfection and the house doesn't burn down. And so the oracle team mandate is a way to formalize this role. So just like how we have risk teams that governance can delegate certain responsibilities to, we can have oracle teams that governance can delegate responsibilities, with respect to oracles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It's oracle team [inaudible 00:28:57], because all of these responsibilities can be split as granular as governance wants them. Maybe particular individuals or groups have specialties that make them more suited to certain responsibilities than others. But essentially, what is the oracle team going to do? Well, there's this delegated party, by you guys, to facilitate the administration and the technical development of the oracles.

Feeds will crash and they need to be notified that they need to bring the feed back up. We release new updates to the bots that the feeds are running all the time, and the feeds need to be notified to upgrade. We release bug fixes for bugs that we find, occasionally. If there is a new collateral asset that is added, the tools need to be updated to support that new asset and then that update that needs to be pushed out to all the different feeds. If we wanted to have a new asset added, we need to deploy the oracle smart contracts. So that is kind of infrastructure deployment and then someone needs to verify that running a bunch of tests to make sure that not only are the smart contracts correct as published, but in the way that they're configured and deployed, that everything is correct there as well. So there's a lot of work that goes on here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So I mentioned earlier, what if we added REP, right? Well, in code, in these tools, you're going to need to define, well, okay, what is this REP token? What exchanges should it get the prices from? What pairs on those exchanges should it grab the price from? Once it has this set of prices, what is the filtering, modeling mechanism that it uses to arrive at a final price? So these are all questions that we have to think about, whether we want to have a generalized framework for every asset to follow or whether we kind of define subclasses and say, well, these types of tokens should be handled this way and these types of tokens should be handled this way, right? So maybe something that's low volume that has very low liquidity needs to be handled very differently from something that has very high liquidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So let me ask one question from Johann. And also, I want to remind people, if you have access to a microphone, please raise your hand. There's functionality to do that in the UI here. Or just jump in and ask a question. But Johann asks, "Have any details been released on how new oracles can be added to the feed?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The feeds are the ones that are feeding the prices into the oracles. So to add a new feed, we have not published anything as of yet, but we will publish something next week. Inside of the oracle governance framework is going to be a section defining the criteria for what it takes to be a feed. And then how we vote that in. And the same goes, actually, for oracles, like your original question stated. If we want to pursue an oracle for some token, how do we do that and what are the requirements the criteria first said that we should take a look at?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So basically, I'm from Chainlink and currently, we have a ETH who has the reference contracts, which has 14 feeds you could call them, which are feeding ETH, who has ETH price and our incentivize with LINK token. And basically, this oracle would be a good add, I think, to what you guys are building. So it was just to get this information. So I can wait until next week for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The oracle team itself does not have special privileges to enact any changes. It's not an executive of government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is a large conversation that we're having. When we introduced these mandates, the community ... there's two different things happening. We're exposing levers and we're allowing the community to begin the process of taking over responsibility for a lot of these activities.

And there is a minimum level of executive privilege given to those oracle teams. And then for specific oracle teams, certain privileges can be granted by governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And governance is expensive in time. So for governance to do something, you're looking at basically a two-week minimum turnaround time from this is a problem, this is the debate, this is the vote and best case scenario. So there are going to be situations where the oracles need to be more agile than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So in the spirit of gradual decentralization, there are going to be situations where the oracle team is going to have to take more of a hands-on role. I just want to make sure that the mandate doesn't come out of the box with this broad executive privilege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Yeah, I was just wondering if the new model requires trust of any sort in the partners. Because as I was reading through the blog post, I noticed we talked about how individuals had to stay pseudonymous pretty much if they were running feeds to avoid bad things happening to them. And so what's to say that these other projects like dYdX and Set couldn't face the same types of situations?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And one of the first things I'm going to talk about is why individuals in organizations kind of have different game theory play out. And so why one is desirable versus the other, and especially in terms of when it comes to identity. So just to kind of go back a little bit, the feeds are the ones that push the asset prices. Currently, we have 15 of them. 14 of those are for the ETH/USD oracle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If you go to MakerDAO.com/feeds, you'll see a very, very sexy dashboard that shows what the oracle price is and it'll show the address and price and timestamp of every single feed that went into constructing that price. So the oracle price that we have right now, the model is that it is the median of all of the feeds. Feeds are compensated. They're paid monthly. And currently, the foundation is footing the bill for that. This is the first time that we're kind of publicly talking about this, but the feeds have been paid about a thousand DAI per month and that's to kind of cover their expenses in terms of infrastructure and to cover their time for promptly addressing any kind of situations that pop up or promptly installing updates and upgrades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It's actually not very decentralized either, if you think about it. And so eventually, the feeds should be compensated from the stability fees. And when that transition happens is up to governance. And along with that, governance should be deciding, how much should feeds get paid? They're providing this valuable service but, apart from that too, there's the risk of bad behavior. So the compensation, in a sense, also has to match the risk of or what is the incentive to be a bad actor, right? But that's a whole can of worms that I don't want to go into right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

There are two individuals within the foundation who actually know the identities of all of the feeds. But as more feeds get added, they will not be made aware of who those feeds are. And so even that will become diluted, eventually, to the point where no one in the world actually knows all the feeds or the majority of the feeds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The big part is what I call the coordination problem. If everyone's identity is public, then you know exactly who you need to kind of bribe, who you need to extort, and you make them a giant target. So this presents a lot of risk to the individual and a risk to the system, as well. If these people are way too easy to communicate and start to group up, that presents a giant risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Here are these organizations, these groups of people. And I made the case that these groups of people should be public. And I think there is a lot of good reasons why. I think groups of people are much harder to coerce, extort, and bribe. They're much more resistant. And another thing that comes into play here is their reputation. So you have this idea of reputation of individuals versus reputation of organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I think he's the only person who has been public about it. If Mariano decides to launch an oracle attack one day, which is that his feed just starts pushing BS prices, Mariano is just some dude in Argentina who's going to be laughing at a bunch of people on the internet being mad at him. When you have something, say 0x, which is an organization based out of San Francisco with a reputation that they need to protect, that they value, because their livelihood depends on their product being successful, their reputation is worth a lot more to them than Mariano's reputation is worth to him. So for an organization to run a feed, it's actually more advantageous to force that organization to be public exactly because they start to put their reputation at stake and their reputation has real value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

That's a good point, Rich. so there's an official agreement with them for a service that they provide.

So another way that reputation factors in is trust by users. So one of the biggest complaints about our oracles has been, "Oh, well, there's this group of 14 or 15 Maker insiders," or whatever, "and they could kill the system at any time they wanted. Why won't they tell us who they are?" To an extent, I understand that criticism but, because of the reasons I said earlier for why they have to stay anonymous, that's basically my response. But since organizations have reputation, their users will inherently trust our oracles more if they know that 0x is running one of the feeds, if they know the dYdX is running one of the feeds, if they know that Dharma is running one of the feeds, if they know that Chainlink is running one of the feeds. So there is an argument to be made here that reputation is hugely beneficial, a public reputation is hugely beneficial when it comes to organizations. Does that answer your question?                                                                                                                                                                               |

One of them, I think the obvious one here being kind of a multisig. So one person does not have the executive power to just control the feed. It needs to be a set of individuals within that organization who all need to sign any kind of ... as you have turn in an organization and people leave, how you go replacing the signatories on that multisig. So, yeah. We will be providing guidance, especially on, for example, how do multisig keys need to be stored, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So one of the benefits of pseudonymous individuals is that the individual feed owners don't know who each other are either, right? So in this new world, the public organizations are going to know who each other are and will have opportunities to all get together in a room and have a meeting about their price feeds, right? So is there any concern here or anything that addresses the possibility of any sort of collusion between the different organizations, with regard to prices?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So I think that's a valid concern and it's up to the governance and the oracle team to be aware of that. So one of the things you can look at is, what is the quorum for an oracle attack to even happen? Is it 51% of the feeds? Is it 70%? Is it 20%? And what is the proportion of public feeds you have to anonymous feeds. And so you can't ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I'll get into this a little bit more in a second, but the entire oracle stack is essentially going to turn into a product. And you want to rope people and you want to rope organizations and you want to rope entire ecosystems into our oracle ecosystem. It provides a certain kind of stickiness to it. And so there's all these different factors that all kind of pull and tug on each other in different directions that you have to juggle here, right? So what is an appropriate level of risk to the system and what is an appropriate level of optimization for a better product, optimization for better access?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So for those of you who didn't read the blog post, the first wave of feed candidates that we have from organizations are dYdX, 0x, Set and Gnosis. These guys have been working with us closely over the past few months in terms of this greater vision we had for the feeds to have these public-facing entities. And they are all already very integrated into our oracle ecosystem in terms of oracle v1, in terms of using our prices. Set protocol has actually been one of our earliest beta partners. They've been using our BTC oracle, which is running on the oracle's V2 stack since back in February, I believe. So that is a long time and they helped us iron out a lot of kinks in the system so it'd be ready to go for Multi-Collateral DAI. dYdX has been using our oracle's V1 from day one. 0X has been using us, as well, for some eternal stuff they've been working on. And Gnosis has been using us for their DutchX auction platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Stakeholders who are using the oracles and therefore have an incentive to, again, be a good feed, in that respect. The more connected you can make the oracle ecosystem, if you can have someone be both an oracle user as well as a feed where launching or participating in an attack actually makes their own system vulnerable to being compromised, the more you can generate those connections, the more you actually lower the overall risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So this one is a little bit controversial, I think, from what I've seen in response to the community. But I think if you think about it, it's going to make a lot of sense. So the last proposal I want to address is the oracle incentives restructuring. And what this is all about is basically creating a balanced model of aligned incentives for all the different stakeholders in the oracle ecosystem to make the oracle infrastructure self-sustainable and more decentralized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And what this means is that each oracle smart contract will have a whitelist that regulates who is allowed to read the prices from that oracle. So if you want to use, say, the ETH/USD oracle, you need to be on the oracle whitelist. And so this is a tool for governance and for MKR holders, in general, to effectively monetize the oracle infrastructure. Because I think what you're going to find is that when eventually this transition of, rather than the development fund paying feeds and it going to stability fees instead, then as we up the numbers of feeds, as we up the numbers of oracles, you're going to find that the costs get pretty, pretty high. And having this tool in our tool belts, should we want to use it to recoup some of those costs, I think can be very beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I can be also used for quid pro-quo business development purposes. So maybe there is a DEX out there that wants to do some kind of stuff using margin and they need oracle prices. And then they come to us and they're like, "You know what? We'll list all of our tokens against DAI if you give us oracle prices." So that can be another way for governance to then leverage, say, the utility of what their oracles provide and actually get something out of it, as well. So there are ways to extract value from this that don't necessarily have to be money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The whitelist does not strengthen the peg or increase the utility of DAI. My bad. So one thing that I want to talk about is, how do we create an incentive, this kind of incentive system? And how would that actually empower us to do different things? So when I say that people on the whitelist may have to pay to read those prices, who are they paying? Well, they're paying the MKR holders because it's all about having this virtual alignment of all the different incentives. So if MKR holders are figuratively paying feeds who are pushing prices to oracles which are providing services for customers and the customers are then paying MKR holders, you have this kind of virtual circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But now, since access to whitelists on oracles will generate revenue, there's actually a direct incentive for MKR governance to look at oracles for assets that are not collateral types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The data consumers are consuming from the smart contract. Often, the oracle smart contract and for the privilege of being on that whitelist, they are [inaudible 01:00:32] MKR holders. And by the way, the way that these payments would work is it would work similar to how the buy and burn currently works. So these payments would essentially go into the stability fee buffer where they then just go through the regular pipeline of buy and burn. So effectively, data consumers would be burning MKR and that's how MKR holders see a benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So proposal 4.5. this is kind of a continuation of what we just talked about in terms of the whitelist. The smart contracts out of the box will come with a whitelist, but I don't actually think governance should use the whitelist right away. And there is a lot of reasons for this. The first is that our oracles, right now, we're one of the first in the Ethereum ecosystem. And they were organically adopted in a lot of different places. So much so that we don't even know all of the different infrastructure that is dependent on our oracles. We could possibly cause a chain reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So seeing who is using them and how are they being used. So flipping the switch and all of a sudden saying, "Nope, you don't get oracles anymore, there's a whitelist now," that could potentially have catastrophic effects. So I would exercise caution and I would like to, before this proposal, that anyone who wants to join the whitelist for any oracle, current and future, can get access for free for one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This gives people time to either transition away from our oracles or gives them time to integrate our oracles and say, "Okay, this is a service that I think is worth paying for." There's a good reason to have it be free, though. That's not just having to do with being a good actor and kind of thinking of the ecosystem. We can kind of be greedy at the same time and say, "Well, we have this infrastructure and we want people to use it."

So I'll just start off with the most interesting thing. So essentially, with the two relatively rapid drops in the stability fee, the borrow rates on Compound, dYdX on a weighted average basis ... I kind of tracked down with that. So essentially, at 20.5, which was sitting there for, say, over a month, that borrow rate started to come down a little bit on those platforms. With the upcoming drop to 18.5%, there's a little bit of an uptick in activity. And then the rates kind of tracked a little. And then again with the 16.5% drop, we have an uptick in activity. And then the rates, again, track. So this is kind of a pattern we've noticed when the stability fee moves, sort of how these borrow rates respond accordingly to basically maintain a somewhat healthy point or two-point buffer, which occasionaly drifts to, say, maybe three, three and a half when there's low utilization and the rate is very high. Or maybe a point when the rate is dropped and utilization is sort of tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So during that same time period, borrow volume, if you see in the last week or two, has risen a bit more for dYdX and a very slight dip for Compound. So compound has been more or less steady with a very slight dip and then dYdX did experience a little bit of a bump with those rate drops. I think part of that has to do with the fact that there were slightly different use cases for dYdX versus Compound. And as those rates get cheaper, you may see people essentially attempting to engage in a bit more fancy footwork in terms of the derivative structures that they try to construct out of the borrowing [inaudible 01:08:08].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

That was rising a bit more, again, for dYdX recently than for Compound. Compound basically came out one to two million and that tracked a little bit with the drop in the stability fee. It was actually a longer-term, steady increase. So again, this excess supply kind of went hand in hand with that although it was increasing a bit more dramatically. So essentially, there's been a bit lower utilisation on these platforms, recently.

So essentially, if you think about this as the stability fee being, quote-on-quote, "too high," and you think of the utilisation on compound as being not artificially propped up, but more of a short-term increase ... and again, we talked about some of the impact of InstaDapp refinancings and things like that. But as it came down to a little bit more of a steady level, then this just became a little bit more of a constant despite the drops in stability fee. So that just means the rates kind of track with that. Demand levels didn't move very much and neither did supply levels, which is kind of why those rates, coming back to here, basically just maintained that buffer because, as it's cheaper to borrow DAI on Maker, then you have fewer refinancings. So a little bit less increase in borrow volume on platforms like compound. Because if there's a one point difference in the rates, maybe some people trust the Maker contracts more or something like that, and so they decided to just keep their CDP positions on Maker. |

So essentially, this supply has been comparatively steady for a little while now. It, interestingly enough, took a slight dip on the 28th. So essentially, there is a large quantity of DAI that was wiped on the 28th, but there wasn't sort of a commensurate refinancing, to secondary lending platforms. So it wasn't so much, I think, refinancing as just a little bit of capitulation of leverage positions, because that overall supply did come down. So essentially, this was when ETH crossed the 170 line, I believe it was. So presumably, some people just had kind of a hard line at 170 bucks for ETH and decided to close out some leverage positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

There was a little bit more debt taken out, but not enough to really cancel out the amount that was wiped. So essentially, part of the question earlier was, okay, why is DAI price still up despite the stability fee having been dropped? Generally, we expect more debt to be drawn out and so more DAI on the market and a bit of a drop in price. And the answer is ultimately because there was not a commensurate increase in DAI supply. So that, presumably, is an indicator that either two things happened to cancel out at the exact same time or the rates were just too high for the demand levels that were out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In ETH terms, this collateral has been pretty steady. There was a bit of an increase in the amount of collateral at the same time that dropped below 170 ETH price. But in dollar terms, that's actually come down a little bit. So that's something I can show you, as well. In dollar terms, the collateral value has been slightly, slowly decreasing, but more or less steady. And then in nominal ETH terms, that has been pretty counter-active to the drops in ITH price. So essentially, people are just managing that buffer level of collateralization that they're comfortable with, which is something that you see time and time again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So essentially, kind of oddly quiet despite the drops in stability fee, which can, I think, be used as evidence for consistent, slow decreases. But again, as always, I would stress taking that cautiously and doing it in small increments, but higher frequency is all right. I think, generally, you should wait a week, at least, to see the effects of these changes, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I mean, comparatively low trading volumes. So you see this, as well, transaction volume has been down a little bit this past month. So I think there is a little bit of a dip in both trading and transaction volume, general activity. And so that's really interesting that the price has stayed up a little bit despite that dip in usage. And so, in the last 24 hours, there's been 1.6 million roughly traded under these exchanges for ETH. That is relatively low and so, take this with a grain of salt, but the price has been kind of hovering in this 1.5% above a dollar range. Essentially, over the last seven days, that same trend is held with roughly 13 million, which is, again, a little bit low in terms of the amount of trading volume. But the price is pretty consistently just a little bit above a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's very hard to say, again, which of those two things is the case, but at least that's what we can see in the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I'm wondering if we're giving people enough time to hear about the stability fee changes. I think there's an expectation that a stability fee change occurs and that people hear about it instantly. And I'm wondering also, as a second part of that, if we have look over longer periods. Is there a possibility that a stability fee change from two weeks ago might be just sort of affecting what's happening now? And is there any way to look at that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It seems like we're making these changes so quickly that we're not, if there is a big effect at some point, we're not going to be able to accurately isolate the cause, potentially.

So if you watch his segment, that's why he's advocating for ... more frequent changes are fine, but at smaller magnitudes, right? We had a whole conversation about this idea of magnitude versus frequency. And also the fact that it's hard to isolate stuff because we operate in the real world. Vishesh has spoken about the fact that the stability fee is very much akin to a sensitivity parameter, almost, because the price action of ETH actually is one of the larger affecting variables on the day-to-day DAI price.

And I think that it's heartening to see what the community is bringing back to the floor but, not only do we need to talk about exponential stepping for the stability fee raises, we also need to talk about how often we're doing this thing. There's still a lack of clarity around whether exposing this button for people to press is incentivizing them to press a button because a button has been presented to them or whether there is pros and cons with just putting a bit of a rate limit around this thing by exposing the vote every two weeks, and see how that works. That needs to get brought to the floor again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's really just a yes or no, do we move to a [crosstalk 01:22:04] cadence?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It's fairly well defined at this point. So there's ideally, I brought the cadence and the exponential thing from Reddit and re-posted it into the forums and then in the forums, it got re-posted into another forum. We're getting some murkiness on where these things arise and maintaining conversations. But ideally, I think that it'd be good to have a brand-new, clean forum post that says, "Here's an encapsulation of all the thinking up until this date about the cadence." Then specify, "Here is the seven or 20, 14 or whatever days that we are going to spend discussing it. And at the end of 14 days or seven days, there will be a poll and then that poll will last for whatever," and then after that, it goes into the governance thing. So I think that there's value in repeating those same steps for everything before it hits the governance poll so that people know what to expect and they don't go on holidays and come back and find out that there was a five-day governance poll that there weren't expecting.                                                                                                                                                            |

So I think that this might be a good place to stick a pin in it. If people still have questions that they want to see addressed or they have new questions they want to add, please go to the forums, I'm begging you, and check out this thread. This is where the summary will be posted, where the videos will be posted.
