Hey everybody, welcome to the July 4th edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting with MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of community development. I will be moderating today's call. We're not going to have a huge turnout. Apparently there's some kind of holiday going on somewhere, so we're going to plow ahead with what we have on our schedule, talk about the peg. We're going to hear from Matthew about his weekly narrative. I'm going to talk a bit about a secret forum that we have. That was my big teaser to try and generate some traffic today. Did not work, but we'll talk about it anyways.                                                                                                                                          |

If you have a microphone, jump right in and let us know what you're thinking. Don't be afraid to interrupt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Something interesting happened in the poll, and I want to call this out, because this is a recurring theme that we discussed over and over in these meetings. That is voter turnout and what does that actually mean, what's the impact of it, what is continuous approval voting, how do we put the signals in the system and why are those important?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It's a hard lesson to learn and it's one that people need to internalize, especially in this ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

At some point in the last few hours, someone sneakily moved their MKR into 18.5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So it's yet another reminder that people should do their best to keep their hands on the wheel when it comes to these polls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I'm not smart enough to know. But I'm assuming that when Vishesh gets into his numbers, we will see that perhaps this is not too outlandish a decision to be made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's no secret at all, it's just unadvertised. What has happened... what has happened? What's happening is that we have lots and lots to go over in these calls. We have very, in the governance ecosystem in general, there's a lot to talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

What we need are venues where we can continue longer term, deeper debates, and really dig into these issues that have more of a window, a time window that allows for these discussions to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Depending on your experiences on Reddit, in my opinion, Reddit is not a good solution for anything, but it's probably the best one we have. But primarily, it's still very time restrictive. You have, depending on the activity in that subreddit, you have a day or maybe a week, in order to interact with a post before it begins to disappear off the front page. That's not great for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Now, we haven't talked about this to the wider world yet, we haven't advertised it. But this is a special group of super smart people. So we're going to invite everyone here to participate with us, in the hopes that we can begin to pre-seed some content there, get some interesting conversations happening. And when we do bring this to the community, there's something for them to bite onto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It's the crypto's favorite forum solution, we did some research, and this is the best one out there by far. So that's what we're going with. We have right now, three major categories, more categories are coming. These sections are spread across major verticals of MakerDAO. So we have governance, we have risk, and we have community development, that are represented right now. More departments from Maker are coming on board soon. So we'll be able to cross pollinate some of our communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We have a problem in governance, where we have these chicken and egg situations, where the existing portal, we understand the limitations around that, there's one vote at a time, one poll at the time. If you decide to signal on a poll, you can't signal on a vote and vice versa. That's all going to be solved very, very soon with the new version of the portal that is being released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So I think I shared a little sort of preview in the forum, and I think maybe that's actually a good segue to start this time. I shared a little preview in the forum. I just, my two cents Rich, I like the forum. I think it's a good UI, easy to use, pretty clear. So might be something that I try to use moving forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The debt ceiling is definitely within like a distance from the supply that we should start to talk about raising that debt ceiling. And I know some of those discussions have already started on the forum and the chats as well and we briefly touched on it in last week's call. So I think that's something to circle back to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We've seen a lot of trading volume, we've seen a little bit of the peg suffering, we've seen some increase in supply. So a lot of these metrics tend to indicate leverage and levering up behavior. So that kind of makes perfect sense. ETH price dips a bit, people lever up, they mint DAI in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So early, it had been, when things were kind of, quote-unquote going well. So it's I think, very facile to like just say the stability fee causes X, Y and Z, and I think a lot of people just want to get to that quick answer, but I think it's a little bit more complicated, where the stability fee changes the reactivity of the system to stressors like ETH. That's kind of like the gist of what I'm going to say today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The last time we checked on this sometime in May or early June, it was like right at 300. So that's like a 20% increase in basically a month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And you can sort of see this kind of curving upward. So there's been, I think, a fair acceleration in the amount of debt that's ever been issued and the amount of debt that has ever been paid back or liquidated has kind of tracked in that rate, although I think that margin between the two has widened, which is good. I think that shows growth. And we just want to make sure that that growth gets realized in terms of revenues, because it does also come with some risks. So that's just kind of like a high level thing to touch on every now and then.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And with the 16.5% decrease as well, had a little bit more variability than it had at 19.5%. And that was something that I had touched on as kind of an indicator that it's a little bit slippery. And so a stressor could push it a little bit further than it could have at 19.5%. And that stressor happened and so it did pressure it a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Even on its own and I think this is a discussion point that has happened on the forums and can happen in this discussion is, to what extent do you need to, as a community, step in and actively push that peg around? Versus allow the kid to drive their bike to school, and so on and so forth, and let it roam free a little bit in the hopes that it will come back to \$1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And that cost is just how easy and profitable is it to use Maker through CDPs, which is the stability fee, that stability fee, like 100% determines profitability. And so it's the trade-off between kind of tightening the variability in the system, versus allowing growth to happen a little bit easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Like even at these levels, we've seen the system grow. And so I don't think you necessarily need to lower the stability fee, I don't think you necessarily need to increase it. I do think if you increase it, it will reduce some of this variability. I don't think it will necessarily 100% contract the supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And it's a little bit tough to do correlations for this, because it's not a one to one relationship. And so these correlations change over time with other variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And I think ultimately, it's like when people are highly levered on CDPs, then DAI has one relationship to ETH. And when people are not highly levered, then DAI has a different relationship to ETH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And so what I think is currently happening is people are not heavily levered up on ETH, or were not heavily levered up on ETH. ETH price sort of dipped down severely and then people started seeking that leverage again, especially at a slightly more attractive rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So as we had this series of stability fee decreases, the supply had been coming down. It's too easy to say that this was as a result of the stability fee, because there was also a lot going on in terms of secondary lending platforms through this April-May period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

But just in terms of the DAI supply, things were fairly quiet in that time period. And I think that was an indicator, that at least for the purposes of minting new DAI, that range was a bit of a steady state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So you see, just around first week of June, the price had been coming down and down. And so I think somewhere around this time period, people decided to start to seek more leverage again. And so that definitely does contribute to the increase in supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And my point is just it's not that simple. The stability fee is kind of like the volume. But ETH is the one that's changing the channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So I think just when you have those things happening together, that's when it's very clear that this supply will increase. And so that is exactly what happened, the supply has increased pretty significantly from around 80 million at the beginning of June to 90.1, 1 million or 2 million, currently. This graph actually cut off the 24 hour delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So what we'd seen was, with that 19.5% increase, you start to see just over time, a decrease in the age of debt. So more and more of that old debt was getting paid back, more and more debt that was being... more and more of the outstanding debt was new. And so this was kind of continuing and then dropped to 17.5, 16.5, that started to reverse. And then 16.5 holding steady, the average age started to drop again for open debt, but for closed debt was holding relatively steady. So what that just means is more new debt was being drawn out.                                                                                                                                                             |

And that was pretty much nominally with price. But then we saw this sort of commensurate decrease again with price, but more aggressive than the ETH price had been decreasing. And so then when we saw sort of a run up again in collateralization, this was in some extent due just to the nominal value of ETH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

With that collateralization ratio, had started to run up partially due to just price and basic math, but it was a little bit more muted than the price would justify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And so what that means is sort of a reinforcement of how we had been thinking about the collateralization ratio, which is obviously it moves when ETH price moves, and that's the short time scale effect. But when the collateralization ratio moves down, because ETH price decreased, there are also liquidations, people start to see more risk in that. And so people will tend top up, sort of as a counter effect to what the price is doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Because once burned, twice shy, they don't want to get liquidated, but to some extent, other people, especially on the higher range of collateralizations I think tend to do pull out some of that collateral, so that they can realize some of their profits, pay back other loans, whatever they're going to do with that capital. I think they don't necessarily want to pay the cost of having more dollars sit in the system. So you see this kind of counter balancing effect on both ends is what I'm saying. |

So I think when the ETH price potentially runs up a little bit, you will see some cashing out behavior. If it happens, obviously. And then that supply should theoretically decrease a bit. And then some of this leveraging will unwind, and you'll see more buying pressure on DAI. And so that could just totally even out on its own, and you may not have to do anything at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And how much are people receiving for supplying DAI?

If they're just sitting with it, how much can those platforms mitigate that cost?                                                                                                                                                                             |

And so this buffer between the stability fee and these rates is actually tightening up a bit, I feel. So it does like drift a little bit at times, but that's not a huge margin, it's just sort of been a comfortable... and I think this tends to be a pattern, a comfortable 3% or 4%, occasionally 5%, occasionally 1%.

But the supply of DAI had come down, even though that had been increasing in sort of a perfect complement to the increase in borrow from secondary lending platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Because what it allows is sort of the narrowing of the gap between supply and demand. And that reduces our oversupply problem that had been experienced in the past, which makes the system more robust, reduces some of the downward price pressure on DAI, and I think is overall a net positive. It's effectively value being thrown down the drain, is being recovered, in the sense that risk was being taken on unnecessarily has been shed for a premium.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

What's really curious is this supply on those secondary lending platforms has run up as well, and sort of jumped in the past week or so. And so as long as this supply exists, there is that buffer that I've been talking about. When this supply is increasing, that makes me sort of think that the increase in supply of DAI might be an increase in oversupply, rather than an increase in demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And I know we always want to believe that the demand is increasing. But it is entirely possible that that has, by and large, or at least to some significant extent, been an increase in oversupply. Now, I don't think it's quite as simple as saying, okay, well, the supply on these comparable platforms was around 14-15 million, and had run up to around 19.5 million. So there's 4.5 million that's attributable to oversupply, and the remaining 5.5 is attributable to demand. I don't think it's quite that simple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I think, right now, you kind of have to, because leverage is sort of that big driving use case for DAI. There's also sort of that volatility shelter, there's legitimate transaction volume, there's the need for flash capital and just legitimately permissionless loans, et cetera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I don't have that graph here in front of us. But trading volume relative to transaction volume has been high. And just historically for DAI.

And so those stability fees have significantly, the paid stability fees have significantly increased as a lot of people know, between sort of March and July.

Because if that circulation is low, then you can see a lot of unrealized revenue. And unrealized revenue is simultaneously future potential revenue that may be underpriced by the market. And so that has a lot of implications for people looking at revenue and valuation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And then on top of that, in the event that some people sort of take this odd exit option and decide to never pay back loans, and have abandoned debt, which is something that we have really no visibility on, we can start to look at sort of stagnant CDPs, and see if this is something that is prevalent at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I think it's been a lot of sort of theoretical discussion about whether that is an actual risk or not. And I know that that was something that like Rune chimed in on in the past, where there's the intent for there to be a sort of exit tax in the switch over to MTD, where if people are not paying back their CDPs, they can't just sort of switch over and get liquidated at a profit. But there may be the intention for some people to just pay the liquidation penalty and sort of not pay their fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Do we know what proportion of DAI is supplied to secondary lending platforms? So, yeah, we do. So at least for dYdX and Compound, which are a big portion of the amount, it's about 19.5 out of 90. And then LoanScan has Dharma's as well, which I haven't checked on recently.

But I think these platforms, especially like Compound, for example, set the rates so that they maintain a relatively steady utilization rate, the interest rates, I mean. But I have not graphed that over time, it should just be the ratio of these two, which if you look at, currently, Compound, 13.8 supplied and 8.5 borrowed. So that gives you a sense. And then similarly for dYdX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But stability fees are, quote, are paid, and cause the deflation of Maker, and so its overall appreciation for everyone. And so Maker, like stability fees are paid literally in Maker. And so that amount of Maker that is used to pay those stability fees goes into a burner wallet where it's never seen again.

And if they're not actively putting this into a use, or they need to store it for any certain amount of time, they can stick that DAI into a secondary lending platform and sort of shave off some of the hit they're taking with the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

No. I think it involves a fair amount of detective work in the sense of tracking transfers between addresses, which is, I think, a pretty heavy chain analysis question of, to what extent can you track the movement of the money straight from the CDPs, all the way to being supplied to those secondary lending platform contracts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I'm wondering about this whole idea of letting the DAI return to the peg on its own. I'm wondering if it's potentially an issue, because I think we want to move DAI back and forth above and below $1 as often as possible, so that we inspire confidence in the eyes of market makers and arbitrageurs. The longer DAI says below $1, the less market makers and arbitrageurs there will because they won't be able to get as good returns if it's staying below \$1 for a significant period of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Actually, this is probably a fallacy. If DAI had always perfectly been $1, then if it drifts below \$1, would market makers immediately think that, oh, I have strong confidence that this will return to peg?                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I think it is helpful for market makers to see DAI oscillates above and below \$1 pretty predicatively. And I have seen it drift from peg before many times and still return to the peg. I actually think in that case, there is a greater confidence that in the event it dips in the future, that they will arbitrage it in the hopes that it will return to peg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I think there are really important questions of, how much has it drifted from the peg and for how long, before we start to... There should be kind of a noise pass filter before you start to use that stability fee as a lever to be changed.                                                                                                                                                                    |

And so having that kind of cut-off really well thought through is important, both in terms of magnitude and in terms of timescale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And the amount of time that it has been drifted from peg, might not be long enough for us to be seriously concerned. Because if we do change the stability fee, in perfect, sort of one to negative one response of movements above and below the peg, we may actually just double the amount of error and noise in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The question is just how much is a little bit, versus a lot? And I do think that 0.984 is within kind of the gray area. But I think if you did increase it by a point, half a point, at this point, that's not wholly unwarranted. If you increase it by a point or two points, I think that's maybe more than... Sorry, more than 1% right now. I think that may be a little bit aggressive. And it's very hard to get to a mathematical equation of what is aggressive, versus not, or too aggressive versus not, in terms of exact percentage terms.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Do you think this would speed up in the future?

But I think what you can say is when that arbitrage cycle is slower, there is a little bit more risk, both for the system and from the market maker perspective. But again, I don't want to speak for market makers. I would much prefer they speak for themselves, in terms of their incentives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Like is it a significant problem if that arbitrage cycle is slower than the ability for a reserve backed coin to mint or burn? I don't think that's necessarily a problem. I think it's always going to be like that, there's always going to be that delta. I think arbitrage mechanics and liquidity constraints are always going to cause sort of that true economic arbitrage from a decentralized market perspective to be a little bit slower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

And as a function of switching to multi collateral DAI, we are basically bifurcating the two, where we're going to have collateral with a set quantity of parameters, whatever that debt ceiling, liquidation ratio, collateralization ratio is for a given collateral, just pick ETH for a moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And this is a risk team question. It's not for me to answer, but should be to the point where it makes the output, any DAI that's minted from that, in effect, riskless. More or less, probably to a 95%. If it's 100%, of course, the risk premium would be infinite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And the question is, how do we go from single collateral DAI to multi collateral DAI? In the context right now, by having to mix or basically ignore risk policy, but only using monetary policy, by changing the risk premium, we've ended up with a stability fee for the underlying collateral of Ethereum of whatever we're at now, 16.5%, which by definition of how many times Maker has had to be minted to cover any losses from a liquidation, which thus far, after a 95% drop in Ethereum with zero, we can argue that 16.5% is too high. In fact, we even had it down to 0.5% and it still didn't have any losses.                                                                                                                                       |

I suspect that it's way, way lower than 16.5. The question really is, how do we go correctly, how do we move from single collateral DAI to multi collateral DAI with a new risk premium that's associated to just the risk, not the quantity? Having nothing to do with the price of DAI, just pricing a collateral quote-unquote package, correctly?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It's obviously not for me to say what we do, but rather, we need to have rough consensus from the community as to, how do we migrate from one to the other? If we've got a new risk premium, or of the existing collateral pool that we're using, and we're migrating, one would assume that if that new risk premium is materially lower, say 2%, instead of 16.5%, if we just flipped the switch, we'd have a surge of DAI, which would erode the price. So there's a sequence that we have to go through to navigate the waters from single collateral to multi collateral, of which we can go through some of those recommendations now, if you want.                                                                        |

Would that risk premium that we're associating in a multi collateral DAI world, is just what does it take to cover the theoretical losses of a liquidation event? It should have nothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with DAI outstanding, nothing to do with the DAI price.

No, this is, I mean, we're going to watch this video in five years and say, look back and say this was a short-term phenomena where we were using the risk premium to handle monetary policy. We should be dealing, the risk premium for every single collateral should be specific to that one collateral package. And also, the covariance is to see if they are related to other collaterals.

More importantly, the moment we start actually, what I would say, correctly pricing the risk premium as it relates to giving collateral package, in effect, segregating, bifurcating monetary policy and risk policy, we will end up with a currently model Ether with a risk premium that's materially lower, which of course, raises the question, what happens to secondary lenders that are used to relatively high rates if we start introducing rates that are reasonable, but we now have a secondary tool to absorb the excess DAI, that maybe they don't have?                        |

I know there are liquidation concerns about how liquid is the secondary market to be able to sell WBTC? And of course, that needs to grow. So what should the risk premium be? Well, it should be pretty high, if there's not a whole lot of liquidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

How high do you have to raise the riskless, risk-free rate to encourage enough would be investors, speculators, to buy DAI, to lock it into a DSR, where they're taking zero risk? How high do you have to raise that number? Again, the DSR is uniform in every single one of the... in every single stability in a multi collateral DAI world.

I'm happy to go on for another half an hour on it if you want it. But the question here is just the sequence. And it's not only what I think, it's how the community kind of views it, and not only where we want to be in five years of having 500 or 600 different types of collateral and a huge portfolio and a stabilized system.

And that is the danger in this whole equation is, how do you maintain risk policy segregated from monetary policy? Because reducing, if by reducing the stability fee, you mean, reducing the DSR and thereby it reduces, we shouldn't be touching the risk premiums associated to a given collateral for the sake of policy to change the price. Unless the conditions on the ground related to that collateral mean that it's now less risky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Well, if people then mint DAI based upon some really high risk premium, well, that's fine. That's why it was insured in the first place. That's the point is, when we take a package, and we derisk it to the point where it is no longer risky, it has been insured and quote-unquote riskless, the DSRs used to mop up the monetary policy, mop up the excess or in the scenario you outlined, when you have too much demand, you might have to decrease the DSR.                                     |

Because at that point, debt ceilings would be far less risky on the individual collateral basis. And if you just lower it to below the current amount of DAI, then you could just basically stop DAI creation from like whatever asset you choose.

Step number two, or excuse me, step three would be to then start to increase that debt ceiling on that second collateral package, and alternate back and forth between that, and increasing the DSR, so that we're not changing the price of DAI, we're not really doing anything that changes the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Until we get to the point where you kind of let it loose in the wild. And once it's on its own two feet, where we have correctly priced collateral package B, with a very low risk premium and a DSR that's effectively mopping it up with whatever that equilibria is or would be, then you drop the collateral, excuse me, you drop the debt ceiling on the first collateral package down to zero. So nobody else new can hit something that's incorrectly priced.                                                                                                                  |

I think there's one interesting point to it. So I think Rich asked how much of the DAI that's drawn from CDPs has ended in the secondary platforms. And I think, I mean, that wouldn't ultimately make much sense, right? Because why would you pay a higher interest rate for borrowing and then lending it out on secondary platforms? Because the interest rate there is, as much as I know, is now lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And meanwhile, they want to hold this inventory in lending platforms. But I don't know how much DAI there is in their inventories now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And I think there's becoming, the awareness is increasing on this extra yield. So this on one hand I think helps us with the peg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Because we have the demand, the people are buying DAI and making extra yield. And don't forget also, that borrowing from secondary platform also is positive for the peg, because these people who are borrowing there and selling it for Ether or whatever, making leverage, they would otherwise go to Maker. And they would issue DAI there and sell it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
