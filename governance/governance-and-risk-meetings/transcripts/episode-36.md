Welcome to the May 23rd edition of this scientific governance and risk meeting. I'm Richard Brown. I never introduce myself on these things. I'm the head of community developments at MakerDAOour We have, an interesting call today. We have a guest from a product team and Chris, correct me if I've gotten your department wrong, I'm not entirely sure where it is but Chris \[inaudible 00:00:26\]. Is going to join us and talk about something that's near and dear to all of our hearts. And that is how the governance portal works now, but more so how it's going to work in the future and solicit some ideas. So that's going to be interesting for us. Steven is going to have a chat about how governance is an ecosystem and then we're going to hand it off the risk because, we've been sort of short changing risks in the last few calls and there's a lot to go over there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And do I ever talk a lot? one thing I'd like to remind people is, we're very, very interested in community feedback. The reason we have these calls primarily is to hear from the people that join these calls. So if you have questions, you got comments, if you have suggestions, please do not be hesitant about sharing those with us. \[inaudible 00:01:25\] them in the chat at the site if you don't have access to a microphone, if you do have access to a microphone and please feel free to jump in and interrupt us at any point. I'm going to paste in a link in the chat to our sub Reddits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So in these calls, we don't make decisions like this is not a governance committee. This is where we debate things we talk about important current events, memes, misconceptions, new trends in the ecosystem. We debate those a bit and then we continue the discussion in the sub Reddit for the next week and then we start making decisions around those things. I think that is going to be my preamble. And I'd like to cut myself off there. So Stephen, I'm going to hand this off to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Thank you for joining us today. Before I get started, the one to thank everybody that approached me during the New York blockchain week. it was really, really quite cool to meet all you guys. And there was one common question I was getting at the NY blockchain weekend. I think it's very important and that is, what the hell is that painting in the background? So that I thought for a second I'll just get out of the pictures. There we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

But anyway, we're here to discuss something in a very interesting in repect to governance. There's an ecosystem that's developing around each stakeholder to the MakerDAO protocol. And obviously with respect to CDP users, with respect to DAI, DAI is effectively the onchain economy, liquidity providers but more so governance. It's I think it's one of those elements where you have a look at the scope of governance and asked about plain and pointed questions about the how do you organize yourself, how do you go about addressing certain issues and addressing certain items that you wish to consider as a group as opposed to as an individual? Now, to that point, what I would like to do is encourage people to self-organise and develop an ecosystem around governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [\#](governance-and-risk-meeting-ep.-36.md#000348) / [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YDss-fS6U&t=00h03m48s) | Steven Becker      | I think it's very important for this interaction to be consistently there as I think it actually underlines the continuous approval system that is in place. So I think it does go hand in hand. So I would really welcome the community to explore everything from that organization through the tooling and considering dashboarding, that can actually pertain to governance. Also keep in mind that any improvements to the tooling or dashboards or processes that you think could benefit to the MakerDAO protocol. Please talk out and please approach Rich because we do have a grants program that can help with that. But the one thing I do want to reiterate is that no matter how you self-organize ecosystem and how you wish to change your doing or provide tooling or dashboarding for the process, the one aspect could keep in mind is that the online scientific governance stays in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

But scientific governance with respect to MakerDAO helps at least to the extent possible minimize the risk of whales influencing the system. But given that I need to go through the normal and typical disclaimers. The first one is that in this meeting, we still in this meeting, we still have three things that we consider the demand and supply imbalance, collateral types, risk parameters and portfolio. And obviously the third one, being exogenous risks. This is decentralized scientific governance that we are trying to altogether facilitate and actually work on it and provide momentum behind. So, that's what this hour is dedicated towards. And also finally, this is the constant reminder that governance is a continuous function. So please be involved as much as possible. So with that, I'm going to hand back over to Rich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

That's, I think that there's an interesting dovetail here too that we can think about it because, governance from my perspective, and this is simply my perspective, it's not make your perspective, but from my perspective, it's a com... It's an extremely hard problem. It's a capital H, hard problem. And, basically every discipline you can think of including, the crypto space. And one of the things that I personally have been wrestling with for a long time is, how do we improve the mechanisms with which we use to conduct governance and MakerDAO and how do we rely on the ecosystem to fill in some of those blanks?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And the DeFi space puts those things together and various combinations. And then we have an economy and it's, that's an amazing thing to watch. There's a potential here to look at governance from the same perspective. So we have a layer one version of governance and that, oh, it's called layer two, which is a portal where people can vote. And then there's all kinds of challenges that we see with, stakeholders and we've talked about those challenges in the past, but, apathy and turnouts and people not knowing whether MKR makes a difference or not knowing whether a and sort of casting about for is, can I just get my MKR to somebody else who does know how to vote and isolate delegation mechanism. And as Stephen pointed out, there's an opportunity for the ecosystem to step up and start answering some of those questions for us. And we're really interested to see that happening. |

As you said, yeah, I'm Chris, part of product team here, ultimately responsible for governance portal and the CDP portal too mainly, yeah, I might even, I said, well, like probably more than aware that governance portal has been around eight months. I think since we had our first foundation principles and we haven't really touched on it since we've released it really that day. It was simply designed for that governance proposal, the foundation proposal, which was a yes or no vote. And over this time it's, it's kind governance as evolved a lot and we haven't really kept up with that on their dashboard, mainly through like MCD being a priority on this. We were going to start looking at it now. And really what this, what this is about really is actually just to request feedback, from all of you who are using the governance portal every week, voting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I don't want to go into details now, or necessarily hear all the feedback on this call. but what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop a post on Reddit, just after I finished, basically just outlining our plans, kind of some of the background and what we want to do moving forward. But just to give you a general idea of what we're looking at here is you've probably seen over the last few weeks that we've all seen it expanded polling from a couple of votes or yes, no vote in the very first vote to a couple of different options. From a percentage increase point of view to more recently when I was becoming more stable to 10 or 11 options. And the dashboard is ultimately completely broken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So the first step we're actually going to do is we're going to disconnect polling from executive voting from kind of behind the scenes in the sense that we are at the moment polling uses DS chief and it uses the same smart contracts under the hood basically. So we're going to take that out. And with that we're going to redesign the entire UI. We're obviously super like, have a lot of knowledge of how governance works under the hood and I don't think we're best placed to decide how that new UI should look, how it should work and so on. So, yeah, I want to hear from all of you really. What do you like in the current one? What don't you like in the current one? What would you really like to see? The new version of polling we have quite a few of the requirements for and we have a general idea of what we want to do with it, which involves ultimately just emitting events as opposed to actually voting on a particular contract.                                                                                                                                                         |

Ultimately, the goal though is to bring more people into governance and the governance process. We have, I think it's 8 or 9,000 unique MKR holders out there. and recently we had 194 unique addresses partaking in governance. So we want to grow that exponentially, kind of within the year really and, and keep that growing more and more. And the more MKR we can get voting or more unique addresses really we can get voting is the kind of measure of success for us really to get someone to drop a summary in the mkrgov sub Reddit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I can't guarantee that all of the kind of feedback will be implemented into the new design. But what we're going to look forward really is patterns in what people are asking for and what people want and where those patterns, we'll put together some prototypes and then hopefully in like four to six weeks, come back to this call with some prototypes and we'll kind of do the same sort of process. We'll talk about them.

But I want to touch on something that you did mention. You said moving from away from the chief to events. And one of the things that, one of the questions I get from the community frequently is where do I see the data for a previous governance activity? And my response is that's where we have a few different tools. The community is coming up with more, dashboarding is coming, but ultimately that's the third party ecosystem thing that we want to foster. And obviously the next question is, okay, well where do I find that data? So in this new model that you guys are planning or architecting, will people still be able to find all the relevant activity on chain or are they going to have to go to an API to get that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

We have been looking at this. Everything will still being on chain. So you'll still be able to analyze all the events and see all the events. And I'll see what is being voted for. And yeah, and hopefully we're going to bring a lot more of that history into the new version as well. That's certainly one of our plans. Certainly a more detailed breakdown of what people are voted on. Yeah, everything's staying on chain. It's still going to be fully auditable and \[inaudible 00:13:22\]. So, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So obviously we have some restrictions in the existing model and we've actually run into those, in the last week we knew that they were there and this is the first time we kind of like hit them head on. And one of those is that, we, the executives have a very continuous approval voting means that we can have a potentially a week executive vote sitting in the system that never gets ratified or it doesn't get ratified before the next poll starts, which is a problem. We're running into a new problem this week where the new executive is not going to get ratified until prior to the newest new executive coming into the system. So I'm actually not entirely clear on what the mechanism there. I'm assuming we just swap out the old unsuccessful executive with the new unsuccessful executive. Is that true?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think it's the executive vote is the same as the winning poll this week. So because it's continuous approval voting. There is no dates or anything attached. So ultimately we can just leave the executive vote carry on basically at 17.5%. So really suggestion there is just the need that as it is onto your point of view, yeah. Multiple votes happening at one time. That's, that's the primary driver for changing it right now at the moment. Yeah. We can only have one vote going on realistically at any time, whether that's polling or executive with a new system, we can have as many polling votes happening at any time and you'll be able to vote on five polling votes at, at once if you'd like to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You could have, for instance, like a cadence polled at the same time as having a stability poll. At the same time, there's maybe proposing new collateral types to add a to the system and it won't matter if they're overlapping at all. You'll be able to go in and you'll be able to read them. You'll be able to vote. Likewise, if there's something happening in the core system on the executive side, you'll still get to partake in that with the same knowledge that there's no MRK one to the other like we saw in the last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I assume a lot of the complexity comes into things because right now it's, it's dead simple because the MKR gets locked and we know where that MKR is. We know who owns that MKR. What mechanism you guys are going to be using to help people voting on like five votes at a time plus an executive? Is there some kind of an IOU token involved or snapshotting or?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's not been fully decided, but I suspect we'll take the, the kind of final block at the end of the poll as a snapshot of everybody's balances. And when you're in a venue alternate, just admitting your address, but you're voting with in the option you want to vote for. So at that block where the poll ends will then take the balances if of all the available, like known contracts that we have plus your wallet balance. So if you've got MKR locked into a vote proxy and locked into chief and locked in and just held in your wallet, we'll actually sum all of those balances up and add that to the running total of the MKR, on that poll. One of the crucial things for us as well though is to actually enable the UI for people to be able to see kind of what that tally might look like, unless of course there's these options where actually it might be better to have hidden results until the end where you don't actually know what's, what's going on until the end. And I'm hoping a discussion forms around that point. But yeah, we'll be using some of them and archive made of some sort to to keep tally, for the UI if we need to.            |

So are you guys primarily looking at things from a user experience perspective and additional feature says perspective or are you also contemplating things like putting requirements or refining how governance works or you're talking about thresholding and upper and lower bounds on particular types of votes or medians between different polling options. Are you looking at any kind of deep mechanisms like that or is it just UI UX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I think one thing we learned a lot from the last vote was that a, or the very first vote, the foundation appraisal is we don't really know what's going to happen in the next 12 months. I think some of the requirements we had that it would only ever be "yes" or "no" votes in polls as one of the first things we talks about. And that that quickly changed. Unfortunately, the system we used enabled us to be able to do that. But like if you ever look at chief now there's just a ton of a blank spells basically in chief that just say "signal your support for x". They just getting used to that three day period and then never, never used again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's become apparent that one of the major use cases for the portal was picking a range of numbers in an easy way.

Or whatever, whatever you, whatever you think like, that's, that's where the feedback's going to be so important because I think we've got some ideas Rich, and then you've got a lot of ideas, but we're so deeply ingrained in this. I think, the most important ideas are from people that just use it, but ultimately twice a week, like Monday to Wednesday, then on a Friday, ideally. So, yeah, it's just a cool way to get involved in much possible in the next two weeks. I think there's been a couple of questions about wireframes, and so on in the thing and realtime board, and so on. we're actually using a \[inaudible 00:19:48\] at the moment which we can share publicly. So as we move on we can drop some things \[inaudible 00:19:53\] and then, yeah, I can add things into Reddit or drop them to Rich to show the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

So let's make sure that we clarify what people can do to get involved.

And then if there are any individuals that would be up to do like a one to one session after these next two weeks, then that would also be great as well that we can take individuals through the portal. Actually let them use it, they'll use a prototype and kind of point out in individual bits that they maybe find confusing or they can't actually see what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So this was more related to, this was more related to the iterations between the stability fee in the DSR. Some people kind of reached out to me and asked basically, kind of fast forward the video where we are today before a DSR and where we'll be in two, three, five, seven years, kind of what we're going to look at it. It's manually we're going to be having a from a governance level, we're going to be going back and forth on what happens when you lower the stability fee and trying to identify the signal of lowering the stability fee than increasing the DSR, and iterating over and over and over. Basically a human version of a PID. But without the I and without the D just the P, the proportional. Basically if DAI is above one, what do we do? And building out that matrix of decisions that we all basically as a group agree is the fundamental decision making you should do to help stabilize DAI back down to a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Once the DSR we can start to lower it and also also at the same time also bring down the stability fee at the same time. Once we get to that window, we're going to find, well this iteration process we'll continue basically bouncing back and forth. This again is not a week of work. It's not a month and it's not a year. It's a couple of years to get that. The challenge again becomes this is still just the P.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

What is the logic right now? Question is right now is how do we identify the difference between going between 19 and a half percent to 17 and a half, but why wasn't 17.37 picked as an example? Right, and it's just right now we're just using, yeah, logical guessing, reasonable logical guessing to determine that and a lot of those decisions are going to be outside the scope of what we as people can identify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Same thing. Whenever we have a DSR, we'll have the reverse of that of knowing how much is locked up and what that does to the price and all that data is, kind of mentioned this on the last call, we're going to want at some point implemented PID. The question is really where and some of the challenges in that kind of chatted with Vishesh about this offline also would be ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Over time, this is not a small engagement to identify. Imagine we had a scenario, let's call it, one or call them at our hundred scenarios or more where as an example if DAI is above one, but it's trending up with a slope of X. But the supply is coming down with a slope of Y. What historically have we done, what historically do we recommend? And then how do we get that information into a blockchain. So blockchain isn't going to process that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So that kind of deep learning we're going to need to be able to iterate on an optimized level is how we're going to ultimately pull this target sweet spot, the overall stability fee down from ... It'll go below 10 and we have the DSR, but getting it to the plant and to stick below four, five, we're going to need algorithms to help us get there. The challenge again will then be how do we set it up such that can't, the system can't be gamed, can be gamed with how do we set up so they can't be attacked and maybe the answer is ... and these are just mean speculating, again, I'm not stating what we will do or what we must do, this is ignorance is bliss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Anyway, that that was the main takeaway from that, some people asked about was how many iterations would it take to get there. And will that be as simple, smooth wine and absolutely it won't. And we will absolutely joyfully hit the black swan that nobody expects. And what scenarios, how much of that will manipulate our data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

That was great and about how willing we are to trust algorithms and what that transition looks like. And I think that as a group perhaps and Cyrus, anybody can correct me if I'm wrong, but we're moving towards this picture where, manually we had to do things manually until we understood basically the broad strokes of how managing risk primers work. It's inevitable that we need to have an algorithm, a somewhere that's crunching a great deal of data and providing some signals for us. And that will transition into this stage where we vote on parameters based on what the models are telling us in any one moment. And then potentially there's some point in the future we'll be able to take our hands off the wheel a bit and let those models or sandbox those models. But let them basically drive some of the decision making process. Is that accurate Cyrus or is that still kind of hard work?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

That kind of ties into this larger, I guess a philosophy and as oppose that ultimately this needs to be governed by humans. That needs to be the final arbitrator. And so we're balancing engagement with the system and potential apathy and all of the concerns about plutocracy and all the rest of those things that go along with governance. On one side that's one of the major cons and the other major con, the side of machines don't care about humans and they'll do whatever machines were told to do. And so having an algorithm go haywire is ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

If you know exactly how the algorithm that's setting your parameters works I'm pretty sure you can back out the cost to manipulate it up to a certain number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And I think that same model applies here, that even if we did have a complex algorithm that we liked and was capable of managing the system, it's impossible to predict that black swan genius that might come in and start playing with our inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Where we have an algorithm that's recommending a certain change or a certain amount and that's just like an input that we take into account in pulling the trigger at least for like the medium term, I would say. Maybe longterm we can really get to kind of this point. But to me the whole PID model is more of like an ideal to work towards as like a broader process. So like with the PID thing, I think there's, there's two like major problems that we have to solve. One is what are the right inputs and then two is how do we properly respond to those inputs?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I think we are squarely in the stage of like discovering what those inputs should be. Even from the process of like me manually running 20 models on the weekend. Like it's, it's really hard to figure out what the right variables are and you kind of have to explore and investigate. it's a really, really human process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I haven't published more about this because it's been a more difficult and I haven't gotten to like really good concrete answers and I want to like make sure I get to those before I start sharing stuff. But the basic ideas I got asked a lot like what is driving DAI price? What's driving, what's the impact of the stability fee? Really like seemingly simple questions. and the answer was often "it depends". Right? And the, the latest like bull run is a or a crypto spring as my poll is indicating, is really kind of challenging a lot of those assumptions and relationships. Like most of the correlations that I found running up through, end of April, completely broke in May. And that's something that we really need to take into account is and what extent are the environmental conditions that we're envisioning, like in terms of what's going on with crypto in general, what's going on with Tether, what's going on with ETH price, just how impactful they are for like what happens to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So yeah, it's extremely challenging to find good, regressions with solid, our squared values that like seem to have random residual clots because there are underlying patterns there that are just not being taken into account because there's variables not taking into account. And so like for example, I had initially, like my first, first stupid rough pass was to try to run a lot of regressions on ETH price and DAI price and like I was getting okay correlations, but the point was I was really missing this concept of like DAI price is not a monolith and I was missing this concept of ETH price is relative, right? To people's perception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

That's a really different variable that has a stronger correlation. And then, it's still an iterative process. Right? So I've gotten to better correlations now than I did two weeks ago, but there's still not good enough in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So I'll try to go through this a little bit quicker. So basically this is a new view that, for most people won't have seen, in terms of a breakdown of what's been going on with DAI Price, in the last 24 hours. And I've kind of been checking in monitoring this, over the past week or so. I think broadly DAI has been hovering just above and just below a dollar, right? Which is to me, proper functionality for DAI. There's always, there should always be, I think this kind of bell curve distribution above and below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And I think that makes a lot of sense, particularly in terms of what we were talking about, this being a fairly asymmetric system where when DAI starts trading above a dollar, it's very quick and easy for the system to arb it down a little bit. And so there's always going to be kind of this more dramatic cutoff above a dollar, but broadly, you can see the volume weighted average price in the last 24 hours is like a dollar o two. So, that to me is broadly reasonable. Some people have kind of commented the most recent trades sometimes is below, but that tends to balance out over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So this is the challenge with looking at more and more realtime data, especially with something like DAI with really low liquidity is you start to introduce a lot of noise to the system, which is why in the past I've preferred much more so to look at like a longer running volume weighted average. So just to hop over and so volume has come up a little bit, but it's still like relatively low levels. we saw, a little over a week ago, two huge, huge volumes. And so let's jump over to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And so I will actually look at that on the longer running chart. So as you can see here, like you see that inane spike in volume as opposed to the more long term. So what's interesting is as the stability fee has come up, the DAI price in like a volume weighted average basis has come up a bit as well. I don't want people to just necessarily think it's as simple as that. But looking in the last couple of weeks, you saw again this crazy spike that I have been talking about. This was a lot of people, as we actually got to touch on, last week, this was a lot of people clearing out debt, a lot of people kind of coming full circle from leveraging up on ETH, to cashing out on some of those profits, buying back a lot of DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Now, there was a big open ended question, last week, which is what are people going to do with this DAI? And everybody was thinking, Oh, DAI is trading 2, 3 cents, above the dollar. Everything is perfect now and we should lower the stability fee. I had suggested that that was maybe a little bit premature and we shouldn't act on kind of this really short timescale trends, which appears to be the case because this is kind of leveled out a bit. But it has been hovering above and below a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So this is really good. I think this is a good data point for us to have in the bank because now we have a frame of reference for understanding what DAI looks like in a "normal scenario".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Like we cannot make significant monetary policy decisions on what happens to the price within like a three or four day period. That to me seems a little bit ridiculous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

But I don't think that was a week to week response. Right? That's different. That's not us saying that something happened within the course of a week and now we're going to make a change because of that. That was us looking at a longterm trend and saying we know by a wide margin that were below where we need to be. And so let's continue to make increases on a relatively weakly timescale, which is two different things in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

That's one of the things I've been concerned about from ever since activity in the governance system ramped up is that we might get lulled into thinking that this is the new normal when it might not be in that we should continuously evaluate what cadences makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So I think that's the constant balance that we're managing here is more time is our friend and it helps us understand how trends kind of level out. But at the same time if we know we're not in the place where we need to be, inaction can be bad for very obvious reasons. So it's definitely a balance we have to continue to manage. What I would say is if we're looking at longer term data trends and making actions on that, that makes sense. If we are responding to intraweek events, and making monetary policy changes on that, that does not make sense. And I think like at the current amount of information that we have, that's probably about as much as I'm like willing to conclude, but I'm sure we'll learn more as we go along.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So, and there's a number of different lines here that people can play around with. The gist was, what's been happening to kind of a slightly smoothed out, longer weighted average of DAI and ETH price. So what's really interesting here is in the past there had been a stronger correlation as I mentioned, inverse to what's been going on with DAI and ETH price. Recently, that has become much more correlated, the course of this month. So that's kind of broken the model a bit, which to me says that there's a deficiency in the model. And so what my suspicion is I need to get a lot more refined on how we think about ETH price short versus long term. And like maybe there's two models here. One like what does DAI do in a bull market situation and what does DAI do in a bear market situation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And I think it makes a lot of sense, like intuitively if you think about it because in a market where ETH is trading cheap relative to where people think it should be, they're going to lever up and DAI price is going to suffer. And so there's going to be kind of an inverse relationship, in a market where people have already done that and now they're just cashing out on that ETH they're trying to run away with a 40% profit or a 30% profit. And so they don't really care about taking a one to 2% haircut if DAI is trading above a dollar. And so in that scenario, you can actually maintain this kind of positive correlation. And so what we need to do is expand our view so that we have a more comprehensive model that can explain both of those situations in which we haven't really been doing up until now because we haven't really seen this kind of positive relationship very much. And so, I think that's what I'm saying where we get to steal a lot of different types of environmental conditions. We learn more and we can refine our models and get better at describing what the hell's going on.                                           |

I just came up there. You're saying that in bull, we don't have to be super responsive with lowering the fee but in a bear we should be fairly responsive and raising a fee. Is that the takeaway?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And what I will qualify is, it's like the bull through the China shop. You know what, in the bull market there is such a strong signal that is kind of wiping out any sort of cost. Like, so there's this calculator that I shared a while back in terms of what's the profitability of leveraging ETH. Like that depressive effect on DAI price of maybe some people are levering up, and they are selling DAI is so outweighed by just the pure transaction value of people cashing out into DAI, that you'll lose all of their signals. It'll just be overwritten and you'll never know what the hell is going on on the other side of the equation because all you see is the strongest signal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Right? So you can have local versus global maximum. So the idea that, and I think this is a really good example for what's going on right now. It's possible that what we are dealing with is a local equilibrium and not a global one. Because as I mentioned, there were a lot of people that cashed out on kind of this full circle leveraged ETH position. And so those people in what I wanted to get to was what's going on with burns and wipes, sorry, burns and draws. Because those people might be sitting with DAI, which means whatever they do next in the longterm might move the equilibrium. So even though right now we might be stable, it's possible for their next action, which is actually just a reaction in a longer timescale to move that equilibrium and potentially break us off of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I don't know. I can't answer that for you, but what I can say is it's entirely possible that right now we are stable, but just that kind of full circle swing of what had been going on with leverage has yet to conclude that we might yet move off that equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I mean, I wouldn't expect another exponential growth in the DAI supply if another ETH bear market hits like we did last year. So everything around the stability fee mechanics, it is almost useless to me, I think from the data perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I just want to make sure we get through a lot of the important part. So supply. Supply has been coming down in the past few weeks, fairly consistently. I had all these prepped, but I reloaded the page. So yeah, you can see here, there were a few like major burns. and I kind of tweeted about this. May 16th was a oddly eventful day. So what we saw actually was shortly after the 19.5% raise, supply had been coming down. There was this weird little run up and then immediately precipitously drop back down. So what I can say is the flywheel is moving and circulation of debt is very strong, so this is a really interesting metric to see. I think it's one of the most important, most underrated metrics about Maker is just how quickly, is debt circulating through the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

What we saw I can't necessarily explain why there is this run up in supply. But what does make a lot more sense, is that supply then significantly dropped as a lot of people were paying back that with newly acquired DAI, a newly purchased DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And anecdotally as well, there've been a lot of reports of sort of refinancings from Maker to other platforms. So that naturally has an associated dip in supply. So just to actually touch on that real quick, because we only have a couple minutes here, so this is what I was talking about in terms of the circulation of debt. The age of debt has just dropped precipitously in the last few weeks. Again, this is sort of around that, May 16th period has just been coming down, which is I think really good. So if there's more debt circulating through the system, there's more realized fees, there's less, accrued outstanding fees and that's just, a healthier state because there's less of a disparity between what's on the surface of what's underlying in the system. And just to touch on the secondary lending rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Dharma is a bigger spread, but those are subsidized. It's really hard to say what the actual, like rates would be without subsidies. And I know that's a conversation. It's been discussed before. it's been suggested that we look at things like Nuo as well. But, there've been a lot of issues with Nuo lately, so I'm fairly comfortable just looking at Compound. It's like the most reliable signal at the moment. and so similarly around that May 16th period, what we saw was kind of a drop, in the rates because there is a corresponding drop in borrow volume. So as fewer \[inaudible 00:55:11\] which is really interesting because it kind of flies in the face of the narrative that people were refinancing until something like Compound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So I'm not really sure where those people were potentially refinancing to or if they just completely exited there a long positions. It's really hard to say what people are doing on other platforms or outside of Maker. I'm going to skip over this now. Collateralization ratios. So just in that same time period, a ton of ETH is removed, which makes sense because a ton of DAI was removed. So why would people just keep eating sitting? But the collateralization ratio has been running up, and been holding fairly steady, which I think again is a metric to watch because it speaks to the idea that people want to maintain this buffer, which means there is still potentially worried about a drop in ETH price. So I think people are fairly neutral on ETH right now. They're not really levering up, they're not really, clearing out their collateral. They're just kind of waiting to see what happens next. Okay. I think that's time.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So, that's one of the things that I've mentioned prior on one of these calls is ETH and DAI price correlation is not so great. And I forget and I think it's around 1.4 or something, but DAI and ETH ratio of short term price to longterm price is stronger. I think that's above 0.5. But with the caveat of in the last few weeks that correlation has really come down. So that's why I really have not felt comfortable sharing that more publicly is just because I don't feel it's a robust enough model yet to explain what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I'm not sure where I got this idea from. It was somewhere I saw something on Twitter, I was Reddit. But the question was asked if there is a logical lower bound on what the stability fee can be, in light of all these alternate lending platforms out there, is it possible that, it just, it's never going to make sense to go below 10% or 8%, once the industry sort of determines what the most common lending rate is?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's been posed on these calls, it's been posted on Twitter, like how do we look at the relationship between the stability fee and secondary lending rates? I want to caution people from using the secondary lending rates as a target for stability fee. Even with like a built in buffer, it is a good input to understanding what's going on, as a response to the existing stability fee. But you just get into a very screwy feedback loop if you start to use it as a target. And I know we've talked about that before. As far as like what happens if we start lowering the stability fee and is there like a realistic floor there and can we discern that for, from other platforms? Sure. If you start to look at what's on those other platforms as a floor, that does make sense because if you've learned the stability fee down to at or below what's on some of those other platforms, you get it back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Neither of those things are, good for the system I feel. But that's when we're talking about the floor. There's a lot of bad things that can happen between here and the floor I think is the point. And so sure we can think about what the floor is, but I don't even think that's the right discussion to have. I think what we're doing now in terms of what's the right level to be at as a target is a much healthier discussion. And I think naturally Maker should be the most expensive. Like it should be the lender of last resort because it's the easiest place to get a loan from. Maker will always lend you out DAI no matter what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They might as well... they could just be buying it on the spot market with their own capital and deploying it completely independently of Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So if those people are incentivized to buy up DAI, that helps to support the price floor on DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And also could be just a short term phenomenon altogether. I mean at the end of the day Maker, which mimics a central bank, it basically is a central bank that has a retail book of clients, thus circumventing, mitigating, removing retail banks. Then the question is why would a person put money in a retail bank to earn what they could earn directly from a central bank?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So it'd be nice to know when that's going to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This is all really great stuff to watch out for. I'm sorry, just to answer the question real quick, in terms of the question was about the secondary lending platform rates and sort of is that a natural or healthy buffer in terms of Maker being more expensive? I mean if you look at Compound right, it's a pretty organic situation. There's no subsidies going on there. It is similarly, a non-fixed time period loan. So I think it's a pretty good data point to look at. At least one of the best ones out there right now. And I think what we've seen is there is this kind of natural buffer that tends to form after the Maker stability fee had come up above a certain point. There was, and enough time was given to propagate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And there's no artificial short term pressure that I can think of that would cause that to happen. And then later reverse, it seems to be a pretty natural trend. And I'm curious if there's disagreement on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

So like that spread, that 3% buffer is really just like people trying to judge like the length at which they're willing to deploy capital on either side or payback capital or hold capital?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So it would just, those rates would move accordingly. So I don't think that would be a factor for people is the short answer. What I do think is interesting is if you look at supply versus borrow volume, on some of these like Compound in particular, there is always been like a very healthy difference between, sorry, not healthy is actually the wrong word. There's just been a significant difference, between the amount that's being supplied on there and the amount that's being borrowed, which is really interesting because, presumably people purchase that DAI are eating the cost of capital and are just keeping it sitting on there. And there's, right... In the last month or so, there's been roughly four, three to 4 million DAI that people have just kept parked on Compound that has never been taken up into alone that they're not earning any money on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

And like the borrow rate is always higher than the supply rate. Like right now the borrower, it's like 18% or something or 16%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

That's the whole thing is the supply bucket takes all of the revenue from the borrow bucket and splits it amongst itself. So it doesn't matter if your DAI is actually borrowed, there's going to be a float of DAI sitting in Compound that's never borrowed, that's meant to be there. And that float is like literally just correlated with that spread on the borrow supply interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And what I started thinking was, well, if you've got, \$1 million that you want to deploy to put that in a CDP, you need 1.5 million to get a million DAI out. But if you buy a million on the open market, then you can go straight to Compound and lend that at the rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This is, I mean suppliers and secondary lending markets, like it doesn't make sense for them to source DAI out of CDPs if they're projecting that their costs on borrowing is going to be higher than their revenue on supplying or the profit from supplying. So it really makes the most sense for savers and for people that just want that passive, sort of low risk revenue stream. Yeah. It's just a different segment of the market. It's just a different group of people, different group of capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But I'm a little confused what you're saying because, in like the case where you're borrowing the DAI, you're, you're paying that 17% well 19.5% and a half percent. Right? And like, whatever the stability fee is. Like there's nobody who's actually lending that diets just, just, the stability fee, it gets burned and MKR. But on Compound, if you have 1 million bucks and like the supply rate is 8% or whatever, what we're seeing right now, listen, that's 80 grand a year on your million. And if you have a million and a half, guess what? That's 80 grand plus for you, it's 120.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If you have 1.5 million in DAI, you're making money on Compound and dYdX is also a pretty, yeah. Mateo has been mentioning in the chat that dYdX is seeing a lot of volume as well. And noticed that the supply rates have been consistently higher than Compound on dYdX. And Vishesh I think that it's worth tracking dYdX supply and borrow rates. I think the supply rate is more consistent than the borrow, but I know, I don't know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

So like if there's a lot of people borrow, like if there is a smaller spread between the borrow supply, sorry, the borrowing volume and the DAI supplied, then the borrow rate jumps up and so the supply rate jumps up and more people are incentivize to jump in and supply DAI on that platform. So there's just like, I think it's just the way that it's coded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If you, if you watch those two rates there's a clear like mathematical relationship between the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I mean I think that buffers is decreased as the Maker stability fee has increased this one point, which is interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

So I think DSR will be kind of more of a monetary policy type of tool. And the risk premium, I mean the stability fee, the collateral parameter I think will be rebranded as the risk premium rate and that will entail or collateral specific discussions.

That's actually why I was asking about, that like inherent bias in being in having like a hard time actually lowering the fee. Like it's really easy to, figure out when to heighten it, but when do you know that DAI is stable but supplies dropping. I guess like just start lowering it when you really see a consistent premium. Yeah. But like that might take a long time. I don't know. Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's an asymmetric system, so it's not the same to raise something versus lower it. And like, especially when you start thinking about some of those discussions that were had around a debt ceiling and all of that is like the perfect example. Just because you wind something up, doesn't mean you can undo the same steps, to unwind it and just, I think that's particularly true with something like DAI, where it's got sort of inherently different economics above and below a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And if, and if, if you guys watched last week's call, for those of you that are in here, Matthew, he talked a bit about, like what it would look like for us to do, like the ideal balance between the stability fee and the DSR. And that initially it will be high and like we should work to iterate it downwards. But again it's theoretic and it's just thinking out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So what do we look at? What's the guiding, like North star, especially as the system becomes way more complicated? Because we can envision a lot of great complicated systems about how we manage this. But in my experience, the simplest like, most constant guiding principle is going to get, 80, 90% of the way there. And right now what I'm thinking is you want to manage up the DAI supply with DAI operating at or around a dollar in the long term, right? So if you have both of those things happening, if days growing and it is stable, that is good. And I think that's-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

But we also need to take into account competition and adoption in the MCD world. So that's a great point.

I agree with Cyrus. I don't agree that Cyrus disagrees with me. So I agree that DAI supply and DAI price are often like in direct conflict with each other. But that's kind of my point is there exists theoretically this proper balance of growing the supply slowly and steadily while keeping DAI at a dollar in the like medium to longterm timescale. And when both of those things are happening in tandem, I think that is excellent. When DAI supply is relatively steady and DAI price is relatively steady at a dollar, I think that's pretty good.

With respect to the DSR. But in that scenario, either one of two things like realistically the supply of DAI is actually not what you think it is. Or like DAI is actually not going to be able to stay at \$1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Because let's say a global DSR of 5%, keeps DAI stable no matter what collateral assets are in the portfolio, 5%, we'll keep it stable. And then you have two assets, a risky one another and high risk and a low risk one. If they both have the same overall stability fee, then people will just keep borrowing off of the riskier one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And the third I'm just going to jump to which is okay, if not that, then what is your definition of success, which I'm really curious about. But the first two is if there are five DAI and those five DAI are equal to a dollar, is that success? And then the second question is if all the DAI that's out there is actually just locked up in the DSR and DAI is trading in a dollar, is that success?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

But that's my point, maximizing buy and burn, it's an equation and one of the variables in that equation is the total amount of DAI being drawn and wiped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

And I think not only that, it's also the scaling of the total DAI supply in this and the scaling of demand for DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

But I'm saying you can optimize for increasing, draw and wipe at the cost of having extra latent risks in your collateral that you're not factoring in. That's, that's exactly my point is you can take some junk grade bonds and assign it a really low risk premium and then you'll have enormous borrowing against it because it's so cheap to borrow against what's typically a risky asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If the simple answer is simple answer is there's no simple answer. But not to be cute. Like if the answer is that we should think about the overall growth and scale of Maker as a system and the amount of DAI is being transacted, the amount of DAI is being drawn and wiped and do we think about DAI being stable and we think about systemic like health risks right in the system like that is, if that's the answer is just add a third kind of category we're not thinking about, which is what is the systemic risk. I think that's totally reasonable. I'm just trying to get to like what is a good definition of success?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

So yeah, I'm saying is that definition of success is not necessarily DAI at a dollar and there's a trillion DAI in circulation. It's actually DAI is at a dollar and there's a very healthy collateral pool. Now the goal is to maximize the DAI supply given a healthy collateral pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
