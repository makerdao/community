My name is Richard Brown, I'm head of community developments. We're going to be talking about risk and governance in this call today. We have a special presentation from Cyrus, he's continuing his presentation of the general model for us. I want to... sorry, I shouldn't skip people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

And then Matthew Rabinowitz will be giving us his weekly recap, sorry, or the weekly narrative towards the end of the hour possibly afterwards. I want to keep momentum up though, so let's scramble through the preamble here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you have a microphone let's leverage that capacity. If you don't have a microphone please type your questions in the chat. And either David and I will be monitoring that and we'll ask the questions for you when we get a chance. Or you can just storm up in there and then after the hour we're going to hanging around for another 30 minutes to just a do a general Q&A. Everyone's more than welcome to hang around for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I'm going to jump in to what I want to talk about, and hopefully not burn up too much time. We have a new forum and that forum was long overdue. There's all kinds of reasons why we waited a bit. I think that that worked out well. There was a critical mass of content that was ready to go, and so we have people jumping into the forum and I could not be happier with how well it has turned out. The content in there is amazing. The way that people were coming together and figuring out what needs to be done, and how we should be doing it is extremely impressive.                                                                                                                 |

I'm typing in the URL that's basically discoverable forum at MakerDAO. Have a look and contribute wherever you can. What I want to talk about today though is merchant processes and workflows and communities. Those are three different things, when you combine them they get even more complicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

These are all super hard questions. To give you some context though we've been solving them slowly over time and introducing them one by one, and now it's time to start putting those pieces together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So we have these calls. These calls are very small time window, they're all held in English. They're in North American friendly time zones. I repeat these caveats every single time. That's why we don't make decisions in these calls. We don't set governance, this isn't where governance happens or governance decisions happen. This is where governance debates and education and community building and social consensus occurs. Where we're all going to figure out whether we're on the same page or not.                                                                                                                                                 |

So valuable that in the near future, I hope, we're going to be expanding these calls to let's do one for the APAC region, let's have another one that's going weekly for the Latin American region. We need more than just one call and we need to expand these things because they're so valuable. But there's all kinds of downsides too so that there's no opportunity for deep debates or deep discussions. We're not going to start pulling apart algorithms in these calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

They're very temporal, so the last for an hour or an hour and a half. If you miss that you're out of luck, you have to watch YouTube. So, it has its pros and has its cons. The pros and cons for each one of these things I'm going to list are basically the same. There's the immediacy, there's sort of this dynamic interaction aspect. And those are always traded off their time to live basically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Potentially, I guess, they could last forever if somebody wants to go back in to the archives and watch 49 straight hours of community calls. They're more than welcome to do it, but that's unlikely to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This other forums or venues are designed to allow for less mediacy, but more long tail utility and discoverability and audibility. Those other locations are the chats. The chats are all... actually, I think that we probably have the best chat in crypto, I'm gonna go on record of saying that. The chat is amazing, but it's also very temporal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We have these really, really cool chats in Rocket that last 20 minutes, an hour at a time, and then they cycle out of visibility after 24 hours or so. It's good for rapid fire debates getting to the heart of an issue. And then coming up with an answer or something, and then having that answer slowly disappear through the history as you scroll up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

And this forum, like I said earlier, is turning out swimmingly. In this forum we have deeper debates, this debates last... they could last forever if you're familiar with the way the debates happen in Ethresear.ch and some other venues that they could potentially happen for months and months at a time, and then go quite and then resurface. That's what we need because there's a lot of complicated things happening right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

There's lots of super smart people that need to be heard. And that needs to happen in a venue that there's no fear that chats or these calls or Reddit, which cycles out after 24 hours or seven days. We have this location where we can all get together, have our say, compose some well thought out arguments and then get feedback from everybody else in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

We need to be concerned about getting to the situation where we start devising canonical documents in the forum. We don't want to be in a position where six months down the line people are constantly referencing this epic thread. And that's where we expect the world to go to discover what it is that happened at MakerDAO at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And once that happens that information needs to move out of the forum and it needs to go somewhere even more canonical than the forum. What we do and what we have been doing for the last year or so, MakerDAO community group, that's just been working out very well is we have a workflow. And that workflow is we iterate with community members on specific projects or ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We discuss those changes in various venues like chat or the forum. And once a final draft has been achieved and this doc has utility to the wider ecosystem is probably going to last, what happens is that document gets taken out of HackMD. They were copied out of forum or out of a chat or out of a Reddit post and it goes into GitHub because that's the world that we live in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It's a flat file content database, it's easily distributed to multiple people or X number of people. It's versionable, it has public audit trail and there's lots and lots of reasons why GitHub is a great place to put a document once that document is finished. So, in the community group we put those documents into GitHub and then after that... another reason why GitHub is so great is that it is easy doing just content there to anything you could possibly imagine.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The discussion starts in Rocket. It'd be nice if we got to have it saying, “Okay, this is a great discussion. Can somebody just recap this for the forums? And then let's take it into the forum.” And if it turns into something perhaps we can say, “All right, let's throw this into HackMD and let's find people that want to own this process or this idea.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So the information that you see coming out of the forum and to GitHub is stuff that is important to decision making from Maker holders. Am I understanding correctly that the types of docs would be like collateral onboarding applications, due diligence stuff? Things of that nature? Or are you also thinking about interesting threads, important conversations, important debates?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

My initial thoughts are, and I don't want to embarrass people and or pick favorites, but I'll do it anyway. Longforwisdom is doing a lot of really cool stuff in the forums. And one of the reasons why I wanted this forum to be out there is because of this continuing heartbreak that I've been experiencing with Reddit over the last year or two where somebody would sit down, put a great deal of time and effort and thought into a forum post, and it would be completely ignored.                                                                                                                                                               |

And as soon as they see a long of text they don't even engage at all. There's not even enough will to complain about things. And I wanted to get around that problem. So in the forums, you've already seen deep engagement, but the second part of that heartbreak was having the stuff age out and not actually go anywhere. And I think that's making sure that it ends up in a place that's discoverable, centrally understood, like, “This is the repo where things go to and this is how we update those things,” goes a long way to making or converting some of these documents into canonical things. |

Is this an idea for some public resource for how to engage with governance? Is this going to be tools and tips for collateral and best super sleuths,” or whatever they call them. So I don't know, we need to figure out some buckets and whether these things live, and whether they actually become official, we need to figure out. But I want to make sure that we start collecting this stuff and it doesn't get lost, because there's just much good work happening.                                                                                                                                                           |

Essentially, the way I'm thinking about it, and I think others are as well, is that we know that borrowers pay stability fee, which is comprised of a few different costs that are associated with the loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And is essentially a value transfer from borrowers to the counter parties who end up holding the DAI. Right? So let's say someone goes out and borrows 100 million DAI and then they want to just flood the market with it, there needs to be some sort of compensation to the counterparty to incentivize them to hold on to that DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The DSR isn't actually live, and so this value transfer doesn't work as we'd like it to. And this has led to, potentially, a higher than normal stability fee. Now, in addition to this fee associated with helping keep DAI stable, there's also this element of credit risk associated with the CDP. And this is a risk compensation, also paid by the borrower, but to the MKR token holders. And we call this the risk premium or the risk premium rate.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And so very simply, we can think of the total stability fee as being the sum of this monetary supply expansion and this credit risk. And then there are a few others as well, such as risk team compensation and some others, but that's not important for right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Well, I think it's pretty clear that it was actually due to the supplier expansion, right? As a community, we've never really even talked about the potential collateral risk of ETH DAI launched with 0.5% stability fee. We only started raising the stability fee as the DAI supply grew, and the DAI peg started to weaken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So, as we approach MCD launch, we got to start thinking about how that DSR portion of the stability fee will evolve once the DSR is actually functioning, and how we're going to handle the risk premium rate. This is what I imagine the setup to look like right now, where we have the bulk of the stability fee being paid for by the monetary expansion and pretty much nothing to the risk premium rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

But then we will have to add back what is the problem reflection of credit risk for the CDP due to the collateral backing it. It's also interesting to note that this right hand side was never really discussed by anyone over the months. Given that the media was always harping on the increasing rates, but technically speaking, there was also somewhat of an offset with the lack of any risk premium being assessed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

And sometimes breaking it down into the individual components can maybe potentially complicate analysis a little bit. This is even more true when we start talking about how different collateral types impacting the DSR might negatively impact... Well, let me just get to the next slide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So let's say the DSR needs to be raised and a price is a certain collateral asset out of the portfolio. Is this something that we care about? Is this something that we should actively stop from happening? My view is that this is not really a risk decision in that point, but more of a business decision by the MKR community on how they want to proceed.                                                                                                  |

And so in my mind the risk premiums are just purely conditions based on a given collateral, whatever the risk associated with that collateral would be. And trying to segregate risk policy and monetary policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I think it's fairly intuitive to segregate the monetary policy and risk policy from a risk perspective. But then if the community wants to go back and manually override certain parameters for the benefit of the collateral type, then that's perfectly doable, possible. Maybe even recommended in some cases, but just want to highlight that that's-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

What he mentioned was, if we just set them correctly in the first place, and that may mean that the DSR should be elevated, and some of the risk premiums actually should be significantly increased. Even if it's not politically appetizing if there's more associated risk, then that's the consequence of risk. It's a risk premium increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This subject area, the reason that I think you and Matthew are both getting involved in the same issue is because this is that intersection between the risk premiums, the risk modeling, and the monetary policy going forward and MCD because... Yeah, Matthew is right. I said that, in the event that we set the risk premiums properly, you wouldn't have this sort of discriminatory effect. But if they are improperly set, there needs to be a plan in place for how could you correct them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But also, a lot of that risk modeling is going to be based on certain behavioral patterns, historical data assumptions. If the system changes significantly, mid flight, you need to be able to have a lever to make adjustments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We're going to need to develop tools to evaluate or analyze when things are out of line. And for example, hopefully we can converge somewhat quickly on what the correct DSR level should be. So that if we see large deviations in the DSR, then we can try to figure out if something is wrong on the other side of the equation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It's also going to be really difficult if a bunch of new collateral types start flooding in at once, right? If, say, every cycle, something like 10 collateral types are added and then the peg adjusts poorly, then it's going to be tough to figure out what was the cause of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I guess what I'm saying is to slowly introduce a very conservative approach, which is very de-risked and naturally progressed downward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

I think design principles are going to become really important to hammer down here. We talk about scientific governance, well, a big part of scientific governance is experimentation and controlling for variables.

And you believe that there is less credit risk there, because you haven't seen a bad environment for it. And so, you leave it open for a year and it's a good year, and over that year you're defining that really the next year is where the problems begin. Which is why I think it also makes us think, a little bit more first principle with some of these and saying, "Well, how much do we want to ease the dial here."                                                                                                                                                                                       |

By credit risk I mean the potential for losses and uncertainties for MKR holders. And so we're uniquely concerned with what these losses look like, how they occur, why they occur, how badly they are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So if you think about it, if you were to completely remove black swans and huge gaps down and be able to liquidate infinite collateral at spot price you'd never have any loss in a CDP no matter what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

There's a very general model of how to do this, which involves looking at the likelihood of default, as well as the severity of the losses or the loss given default. But these general models are sometimes just intuition driven.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So for example, calculating loss metrics for an ETH backed CDP is much different than if you were trying to figure out your risk on a credit card loan. And the reason being should also be somewhat intuitive in the sense that for credit cards you could probably look back at 100 years or whatever of credit card data and estimate what these frequencies should be, because they probably don't change dramatically over time. But with Ether we don't have a lot of historical data, we don't have great intuition and how it evolves.                                                                                         |

So first step is you collect your inputs, which is your due diligence report, your risk rating, the onboarding application. You have your trading history, you have historical CDP stats, and you have the current CDP distribution.

And collateralization ratios essentially change based on the underlying asset price, as well as user behavior. And so, when we dive into these risk factors we want to know, "What does ETH do? How does it move?" And for behavior, "What do users do in response to... for one, ETH price drops?"

So we're looking for fundamental information that can impact asset prices. I mean, typically, things that aren't immediately clear just by looking at the price chart. And that can be just... A simple classification is, you can have fundamental risks, protocol risks, exchange risks and regulatory. And obviously, these are pretty important to understand as we create CDPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

And so once you've defined and analyzed your risk factors, you essentially want to simulate them to see how they intermixed with each other and how they evolve over time. And so what we're doing is, we start with the current CDP distribution, and at every time increment forward we apply a function that is a change in the asset price. And we model this using a stochastic asset pricing model, which we discussed a little bit last week.                                                                                                                                                                         |

Obviously, we know that liquidations can occur slowly or can get downwards. We also apply behavior function that increases or decreases the amount of DAI drawn, or the amount of ETH locked up. This is a whole aspect of research in itself. And then we also apply a slippage function to deal with liquidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Right. So let's say you do this thousands of times and you end up with a distribution of losses. And some of these paths nothing happens, right? ETH price just goes up, no liquidations fine. Some of these paths you'll have liquidations but... Some you'll have liquidations but the collateral is fine. Some will have liquidations, but the collateral is not fine because of liquidity.                                                                                                                                                                 |

So you have some paths that are fine, and plenty that reach the collateralization ratio threshold. And for those you want to apply a slippage analysis. Now we can have a handle on for a particular CDP or group of CDPs, what can we expect to lose for MKR holders? How much bad debt is expected to be triggered?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So there needs to be some sort of risk compensation for this. And of course, that is what the risk premium rate is in the first place. And so you convert that expected loss into this credit spread, which is actually quite simple calculation at this point, once you've done the simulations. We talked a little bit about this last week as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And then, so back to what I was talking about last week with the whole options analogy. And essentially, if you were to simplify that simulation, with a bunch of assumptions, such as no behavioral changes, no jump risk, and a few others, your loss distribution is equivalent to that of a put option on the underlying collateral Ether. And intuitively, this should make sense that MKR holders, they are behaviorally short a put, right? When the Ether price collapses their losses increase the further the price goes down, but they receive stability fees as compensation for that.                                                                                                                                                     |

But, of course, we can't exactly do that analytically, because we do have to factor in behavior and jump risk and a whole bunch of other stuff. Another way to describe this example is, if you had a CDP with 100 DAI debt and a \$200 liquidation price. And then you constructed a put option with the same parameters, then the CDP would be completely riskless. There'd be no way for the CDP to lose money, because as Ether price dips below 200 the put option will perfectly offset any losses.                                                                                                                                                         |

And so, now that we've removed this hypothetical put, then you can reason about what that risk premium should be. Essentially it's dependent on what the price of this put is.

Sorry, of the buyer is always greater than or equal to the value of the put. Right? Because in... sorry, to the seller. Third correction. The seller can get back at least that value or they can get more if they can exercise and keep the difference. Right? Insofar as you believe that a CDP owner has properly rebalanced. So, not only does the default not happen, i.e loss didn't materialize, you also now have a put option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

That's assuming the MKR... So implicitly, if the MKR holder is selling a put, implicitly you're saying the CDP owner is buying that put, right? Somebody has to buy it if you're selling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It's really a pool of CDPs that are entering and exiting all these different states. And so, basically, the idea is net equilibrium.

One of the interesting insights from looking at this from an options perspective is that aspects that are important to options pricing are also relevant to us, and in particular the volatility. When we talk about the volatility of the CDP, and in particular, the default risk and all that we're pretty interested in the tails, right? And tail risk is, obviously, one of the most important aspects of risk management for Maker. And while there's no simple way to read in about the tails for a bunch of reasons that I've mentioned before, we are looking at three components of the volatility here.                                                                                                                               |

And then, finally, probably the most important one being these fundamental risk factors that caused the sudden gap, sudden gaps downward. And so some of the research we've been doing here is, we've been going back and collecting data on all of the major losses and draw downs of the Ether price for the past couple years. And classifying them by what caused them and a whole bunch of different metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And using these metrics you can have an approximation of, one, how frequent these big draw downs are, and two, the severity of these losses. And that way we can input these these metrics into our simulation to help create more realistic tails for the losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So for example, redoing this analysis, but for Bitcoin, and then making the assumption that the frequency and severity of ETH draw down is somewhat correlated to Bitcoins as well. And by doing so you can maybe get more data into your model. But essentially, the goal here is, essentially...

So for example, if you have your liquidation ratio at 200%, then losses would be significantly lower and stability fees would also be lower. We'll talk about this next time with liquidity analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is for when we're basically creating and needing to determine a risk premium completely vanilla when we don't have any background behind it. How would we compare... I think we've mentioned this one. So it's like a credit default swap or a bond for a given company, doesn't matter, that's got a credit rating and a CDS that's a known CDS. How much of our risk work would we... I wouldn't use the word outsource but, get guidance from, inspiration from to get some of those metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So it'll be interesting to see if... sometimes the stability fee increases are timed hilariously poorly with ETH price movements. So it's hard to tell, which had an effect, but it will be interesting to get more data points to see if this actually pushes up the DAI price at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Similarly, the DAI price did a similar thing where it was holding pretty steady and then took a hit. This is primarily leverage in this area. And then as ETH price started to recover a little bit, DAI price starting to recover a little bit and then ETH took another nosedive. And even the most recent nosedive is cut-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We should talk about it today in this call because it's an interesting... probably the first example of a signal being raised in the forum that could potentially precede a pole in the governance system.

And depending on the results, next week or week afterwards we're going to replace the stability fee with the debt ceiling raise.                                                                                                                                            |

Right now we're seeing the price degrade a little bit and we've just raised the stability fee. So maybe there's a wisdom in saying we need to have another week between the two. So in my mind, raising the debt ceiling doesn't really present a material risk unless we change the debt ceiling to some huge number, which we've discussed on the forum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Because we've got so many items that we have to get rough consensus on related to MCD, the debt ceiling is just some brain damage we have in the middle.

And so technical debt, we could talk for hours about the philosophies around technical debt, but it needs to be addressed. The question that I'm posing though is, doesn't need to be dressed in the next three weeks? Because sure, cleaning up the number of decisions that we need to make, it would be useful. But is that utility more than the expense of losing flexibility on the stability features?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

No, I have two questions, because I don't know the answer, so they're not rhetorical. Do we need to do this now is the question and here's from my neophyte financial analysis. I thought that we have a debt ceiling because of liquidity risk, right? Cyrus correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't the idea here that we have 100 million because somebody did math somewhere that said that over a 24 hour period in this market we can comfortably liquidate X amount through the mechanisms, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Right? Each time we go through a poll and then an executive votes, there's a two week cycle between those two points. And knowing the quantity of things we have to vote on and the community not knowing when soon is. I'm trying to take the more conservative approach of let's raise, get rid of the headache, get rid of the brain damage earlier than later. Or at least push it off for enough time to allow us to get through the rest of the consensus that we need to be able to launch.                                                                                                                                    |

So when we say the same thing is coy and it's cute, and all the rest of it. But one of the primary reasons we say soon is because we don't know exactly, and so that's even more unsatisfying. But here's why we don't know because Cyrus and I, and a bunch of other people have been spending... you'd be shocked to learn how much time we've been spending in meetings over the last two weeks trying to figure out how we can optimize to speed up the process to get us to MCD launch.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The takeaway over and over again, is that when MCD launches has nothing to do with... Well, I shouldn't say nothing. It's not up to MakerDAO, it's up to the community. And it's up to governance. And it's up to the risk teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We have a significant amount of work that needs to be completed. And I've touched on this in the blog posts that have gone out recently. But we need to get the general model in, we need to evaluate these asset classes. We need to find out how much debate is going to be kicked out by these things. We need to figure out the communities, or the governance Maker token voters appetite for risks, or their appetite for complexity in the system.                                                                                                                                                                            |

And how do we determine that the signal has started and the signal has ended and that we're all comfortable with the quality of that signal?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It goes into a forum thread, it goes into discussion. At some point that discussion ends or a poll ends. We review it in a governance call saying like... well, actually we're doing it right now, so this is more acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

We have a little chitchat and then at some point that just turns into a poll. That turning into a pole thing is a significant events right now because we can only have one poll at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

There was some mention of big, chunky \$1 million DAI transactions in the last couple days. But in the grand scheme of things, that's really not very huge. I mean, really, at the end of June we saw a 4.3 million DAI minted in one day. So that significantly puts things in perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

When you increase the stability fee, you do tend to see a little bit more of a refinancing over to secondary lending platforms. But even through the 18.5% increase, overall, the supply did continue to increase. And it's leveled out around that 91.3 million level. Some of this is also potentially explained by what's been going on with secondary lending platforms. But overall, it has been increasing that circulation.                                                                                                                                                                |

So essentially, this is due to new debt being created, and not much more old debt is being paid back. Although there was a slight decrease through the most recent stability fee increases. More DAI is being drawn from new CDPs than old over the course of the month, which does make sense with a lot of new DAI being minted. And some of this may be due to the fact that the same potential owners at the end of the day have opened new CDPs because they previously closed old ones.                                                                                                                                                    |

Although, far more dramatically than the ETH price actually moved, if you look at nominal percentage terms. So this echoes that idea that, as the ETH price decreases, collateralization in the short term decreases, but then people do tend to increase their collateral to "top up".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

So again, as the collateralization shoots up due to ETH price in the short term, people do tend to pull collateral out commensurately. And so you saw this increase in leverage right at the end of June, beginning of July, which corresponded with some of the "damage to the DAI price."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

May was kind of an explosion for the secondary lending platforms. June has been a steady increase in borrow volume, and supply volume as well. Hard to see from these graphs, but the supply volume has outpaced the borrow volume a little bit more. So that you see in this excess supply graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And so this does tend to pretty closely correspond with those rates. Because a lot of these platforms actually just algorithmically set rates based on what this "cashflow" is. So that rate has... that excess supply being increasing through the month of June and into early July, with a bit of a dip around that same June 25 time period where the ETH price had peaked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Although a little bit of dip now recently, as people heard that 18.5% was coming around the bend. So the excess has decreased as DAI got more expensive, which made sense. But initially, it was running up with that DAI supply. That was interesting, potentially people purchasing DAI from others who were selling it for leverage, and then relending it on secondary lending platforms just to get a little bit extra interest.                                                                                                                                                  |

So I had looked at this initially to see if there is a relationship between the stability fee and the utilization rates on the secondary lending platforms. To basically circle back to an old conversation that we had with Rich around to what extent can use secondary lending platforms to learn what to do with the stability fee or other monetary policy things on Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

But during the time period when the stability fee is flat, you also do see some pretty solid fluctuation in these rates. So what I'm basically saying is, when the stability fee has being changed, or other significant monetary policy components are being changed on Maker, you need to wait, I think, for some of these metrics to settle on the secondary lending platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And so, it's been a complex, I think, point to touch on. Some people talking about, "To what extent is this supply, people who've leveraged out of DAI and sold it and other people who are just purchasing it and lending. Versus people who are actually drawing DAI out, and then holding on to it, and in the meantime, actually lending it out of these secondary lending platforms."                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's significantly outpaced the increase in trading volume during that time. So it's not just attributable to trading volume. So I think that's a pretty positive indicator for people who are wanting to look at, to what extent is diet being used and transacted on outside of just being traded for leverage? Because it does appear to have picked up fairly significantly.                                                                                                                                                                    |

Some people have talked about, "Oh, there was a significant amount of liquidations recently." Just want to put that in perspective. The liquidations recently have been, yes present, but overall in the grand scheme of things not huge. And have actually been at fairly high collateralization ratios. So this can potentially be attributable to less volatility in the ETH price, although I think we know that's not true.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

And there are sometimes changes to the collateralization ratio, and liquidations in the same block in the same transaction hash. And so, ordering those events properly is sometimes a little bit tricky. And ordering them also in the same block price tick because there tends to be liquidation in the block that there is a price tick. So getting that level of precision and being 100% confident is hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

But pretty much every data set, there's just one liquidation I've kept my eyes on. Happened early on, and it happened at 154% collateralization. But pretty much every data set I've seen around Maker shows that same blip. But it's very tiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

But I think those are very small CDPs were that rounding error can make things seem a little bit more extreme than it is. So accepting those cases, buying large, yeah, I think the collateralizations have all been in this range, roughly. So the takeaway is, overall collateral sessions have been pretty safe, and they've gotten safer recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Collateralization overall, has come up hugely from a year ago, six months ago. But also, I think, a little bit of improvement in efficiency of how the keepers are operating and how quickly they're getting to those liquidations, but the latter is really, really difficult to show on the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And then, yeah, I answered. 18.5, again, I would have waited from the 17.5% increase to see what would happen before even doing the 18.5% increase. That happened rather quickly, in my opinion. A further potential increase, I think, is a little bit premature. So I am generally going to recommend more wait and see and collection of data mentality before making potentially rash decision. Because, I think some of the effects of these changes to take time to realize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
