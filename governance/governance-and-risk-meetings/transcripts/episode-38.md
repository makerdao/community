We have a more interesting ... we're shaking things up a bit; I shouldn't say more interesting because they're always interesting. But we're doing something a little different today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Even before that, we talked about how these calls will have different themes based on what the subject matter is. Previously, they've been focused exclusively on supply and demand and balance. It's too early to say that we're out of the woods in that area, but I think that we're past the point where it requires a full hours meeting every week in order to manage. We'll still be touching on it, but there's a lot that needs to be discussed in these calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We need to start discussing what that might look like. And of course, we have multi-collateral DAI coming at us soon, trademark, and we need to get prepared for that, and that means we need to talk about collateral risk and happily, we have a series of experts on the call today which are going to start setting the stage for us. I'll hand that off to Cyrus in a second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We have a lot to go over in these calls, far too much for us to handle with a back and forth, or with a few moderators speaking. So, I'm going to post a link into the Zoom group chat, which is a link to our r/mkrgov subreddit. In that subreddit every week, we have a thread; in that thread, there is an agenda for the call that we're having right now. There is also a summary of the call that gets posted there in a couple hours after we're finished, and that's where I would like people to continue the discussion and continue the debate, dig into issues, surface some more, and then keep the conversation going. Because there isn't enough time today to do all of the things we need to do. If you have questions that didn't get addressed in the call, please add them to that thread. Next week, if you feel that there's things that you would like us to address in the calls, and you see the agenda thread come up on Reddit, please feel free to pre populate, let's front-load some questions into these things so we have things to address or we know, or we know what's on people's radars when we come into these calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

They are human nature issues. We have a voting system that we need people to participate in. We need people to feel like they're engaged in that process.

Like I said, these are things that are common to every single voting system that's ever been created in the history of humanity. As far as I'm aware, the solutions to these problems are just communication and outreach and putting the right tooling in front of people. There's no magic bullets here. Potentially, crypto will save us at some point, I'm not sure what that's going to look like or how it's going to work; perhaps somebody will come up with an un-gameable incentivization mechanism. Maybe that's what everybody was waiting for. I'm not holding my breath. Maybe we move to a delegation system.

One of those examples, as a live example right now, if you look in the polling system, you can see that 8,000 Maker was staked on 12.5% stability fee. And perhaps, I shouldn't be too hasty; perhaps that person is a financial genius and just sees something that nobody else sees, and that's the stability fee that we should all be using right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And so, the question becomes, "Why did this happen?" Well, actually, there's two questions: why did this happen, and how do we secure the system against being moved by people that are wacky in their opinions, possibly? We'll get to the answer to the first question in a second. The answer to the second one is that, if the peg is stable, that doesn't mean that Maker should be coming out of the governance portal, or that your incentive to vote hasn't gone away, that the requirement of having an active voting community has stopped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Please keep track of what's going on. The first problem that I alluded to, and I skipped over, is how do we solve some of the issues that we have in a governance system that's been plaguing humanity for all of time. And here's a rapid fire list of the things that we're already doing. If we've missed something, if there's something the community [inaudible 00:09:03], people have ideas, please let us know. And I'm going to start hitting some themes that I've talked on in many, many other calls. This discussion we have right now is a very small, small window with a very small demographic. We cannot fall into the trap of relying on this one hour, one hour and a half time period as being a place where decisions get made and information gets dispersed. This is the first of many places where information gets dispersed and people have to base. The decision making process happens over time, through debates and texts and chats, and then ultimately happens in the governance portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

We're building a solution for the world, and we cannot have debates in the most convenient time for North American viewers. We need to have calls in the APAC Region, we need to have calls in Latin American, we need to have calls in friendlier timezones, in Europe, and those are going to be popping up in the next few months, I think. Month of two, let's call it that. It's going to take a lot of work and a lot of coordination. We need to figure out how these individual calls sync up and how they stay on the same page and continues their correct narratives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Those summaries are recaps of the discussions around governance, around risk, with handy links into the YouTube videos for people that actually want to see what was discussed. Those have turned out to be very popular. I think that the next step is to begin translating those into the top five, ten languages of our stakeholders. And begin having our community members rebroadcast those out so we can get a global reach. So at least people know what's happening, or what was discussed in these calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So we can pull from more than just a signal and stability fee, we can pull for a new cadence on the votes, we can pull for a new stepping of the rates that we're pondering for the new stability fees, which is going to be very important. We are constantly iterating on our analytics, which I think is one of the key pieces of this puzzle. We need to be in a position where voters have very clearly understood and readily accessible resources that allow them to say to themselves, "Well, it's time for me to vote. I need to go to this page and figure out what the state of the system is, make up my mind, and then vote." There needs to be a very clear path for informing voters and then allowing them to exercise their will. That's something that we're working towards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

That's not what people like to hear, but that's just the way things go. We're going to make it easier for people to do that work by providing better tooling and greater visibility into what's happening.

So, I can only imagine how awesome it's going to be in six months, which is me leaving things on a high note. I like to do that because it scares people sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I think one interesting aspect is that us having the really high cadence with polling helps mitigate any mistakes or ... not mistakes, but any undesirable outcomes with the governance process, right? Because if some crazy vote goes through, we can potentially undo it within a week or so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And I think that ultimately, the situation we have here is that we don't have a polling or a push solution that allows us to communicate with voters, which is tricky. This is something ... a larger thread that we need to sort of untangle here, but we need to be able to be in a position to alert people; everybody who is holding Maker that, "Hey, something weird happened. You need to vote on this thing," or, "Nothing weird is happening," or, "We're not having a vote this week." What that looks like, I don't know yet, but without ... the regular cadence gives us an opportunity to create this expectation, people need to check in every seven days, they know that [inaudible 00:14:48] to deal with things. If we moved it to, "Let's only vote when things are important," how do we bring people back when something important happens?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Add it to the Reddit thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So, Coinbase is a new component to this breakdown, which is great. The spread is kind of ... it's drifted below a bit recently. So, I think that's something to watch. For the past week or two, there'd been kind of a large spike centered on a dollar, and then kind of a little bit more normal distribution. So this is kind of skewed a little bit now, which has been the case for the past few days. I think that's definitely something to watch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So, Uniswap, for example, you'll tend to see this more rectangular distribution across different price points. Whereas, Oasis, you'll tend to see a huge centralization around a dollar, or whatever the median price is. And then, some of these smaller exchanges, you'll see more of the outlier prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And then, Coinbase is kind of chunked around the middle as well. It's interesting to see sort of with people constructing a lot of cross exchange trades and dYdX playing more of a roll and stuff like that, I think it's going to be interesting to note just how people are trading DAI and where, and what kind of patterns start to emerge for what prices you can get on different platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I'm always fearful of live updating data as we talk. Something could break. Yeah, so the DAI price has been doing pretty well. There's been some variation dipping below in the past week or so, but for the broader one month timescale, it's been fairly steady, basically around a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

You do see some of it dipping below a dollar clearly, but it just really doesn't show the variation as much, which is something that I can add as an additional layer for next time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So I think that's ... maybe one of these leading indicators that will start to emerge is when the stability fee is lowered, when there's more leveraging behavior. I think whereas in the past, DAI would just immediately start trading below a dollar and stay below a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

But I think the situation has changed a bit now, where when DAI dips below a dollar, there is an increased likelihood that people will actually take that as an arbitrage opportunity and actually buy up DAI. It's very hard to say that for sure, but I think given increased variability of prices below a dollar, but still volume weighted, remaining close to a dollar, I think is a data point that evidences that case. So, that's maybe something to watch though as a leading indicator of potential drifting from the peg, is just more of that variability in price below a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It's going to be entirely too soon to see any effects from the most recent change. And I know a lot of people will claim otherwise, but I think an important note with the governance process and the timing of all this is just to kind of take things slowly and with a grain of salt because I think if we try to draw too many conclusions off of short timescale movements, we're going to be chasing our tails in terms of just following noise rather than signals.

In terms of DAI price and ETH price, I think this trend is reversed as we talked about over the past month or so, where it's not necessarily the case that when ETH price is rising, DAI price is falling. Whereas in the past, that relationship had been stronger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So, in the past, that was an easy explanation. As that unwinding should have winded down, theoretically, that kind of over arching effect would decrease. I don't think we can really use that as a justification anymore. So now, it's really interesting to start to examine why DAI and ETH have actually tracked fairly well. And I think that now really starts to get to more of a discussion about derivatives and lending, because I think that's a huge part of what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

There were a few days where there were some significant draws. There were also some significant wipes on those same days. But the draws had kind of outweighed the wipes, which is very interesting to note. I do think, and we can talk about the loan origination. I do think a lot of the refinancing has slowed down actually to where there are fewer people that are moving their loans from Maker to the secondary platforms. Partly, it makes sense since the stability fee has come down in the past few weeks, but it also, I think, was a big initial burst, especially with Compound v2 being recent released, dYdX starting to pick up some steam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

But that would naturally have slowed down. So, that makes sense. And then, obviously, the rate changes make things a little bit more attractive to just stay on Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And it's a really complex question to consider, how do we discount a 17% rate on Compound versus dYdX, and really start to think about those kind of non ...

The rate of change has definitely slowed down. So, you know, more old debt had been cleared out, more new debt had been drawn. That seems to have just kind of held steady, and I think, is leveling out to like a fairly equilibrium point. But what's interesting is that equilibrium point is sitting with the age, the average age of debt that is open, lower than the average age of debt that I closed. So, open debt is younger than closed debt, which means consistently, we're sort of eating into that backlog at a fairly steady state rate. Which is really interesting.

Yeah, it's a million dollar question and there's been a lot of back and forth about this on the rocket chat in the past week or so. My short answer, which I think is maybe me copping out a little bit, because it's an easy answer, is that there's no defined time period. I do think there is like a certain, minimum level of resolution that we'll never be able to act faster than in the way things are currently structured, and that's probably like a three to five day timescale. I don't think if you change the stability fee, you can reasonably expect to have seen stabilized effects of that change faster than three days, and I think probably more reasonable, is not faster than five days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Now, the bigger thing I think is not what's that minimum timescale, because as long as we're agreed to wait like three days before making a conclusion, the bigger thing is actually, and I don't think that's super contemptuous. The weird thing I think is when you make a change, and then there's a subsequent change going on in the environment, how do you decide to reset that timescale. And that's a much harder question, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And yet, people might, at the simplest level think, "Oh, we dropped the stability fee, the price stayed the same. Let's drop it further." Or they might think, "We dropped the stability fee, price dropped. Let's increase it again." But it might have nothing to do with the stability fee because there's a more significant signal going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So when there is significant movements in ETH price, we know this. There is significant changes in transaction volume on DAI. We know that tends to correlate with movements in DAI price. [crosstalk 00:29:14] Kinds of things that ... Well, if not a leading indicator, right? Because leading indicators are very difficult, because we know it has an effect. Do we know whether that effect is positive or negative at any give point in time is actually not as predictable. There are different use cases and different reasons why it might switch from a positive to a negative correlation, which is really a bit like there's an underlying behavior that's correlated. That underlying behavior manifests in the price, but is not an easy one to one mathematical, linear relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

That's what I think it's about.

We still need to understand inventory levels, because they could be accumulating or decreasing at rates that are not entirely visible to us, so it might look like everything's fine, but people could be accumulating large inventories behind the scenes, and becoming increasingly unhappy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It is also an important data point to look at the amount of DAI that trades above and below a dollar. That's why I've started to show this spread more often is because I think it's important to highlight the difference between the averages just kind of came out to a dollar, versus more DAI was trade below a dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

What that indicates is that there is some underlying movement going on, some changes in the ecosystem. I think we tend to lose sight of that when we just look at the average sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

I just want to make sure we touch on this. This has come down fairly significantly in the past ... Well, we keep redefining our definition of significant has ... It went from 370, 360 to 540. But it has now come down from 540 to 460, which is interesting. I think this lines up, at least in one way of looking at it, with what's been going on with the DAI price, what's been going on with supply, right? The DAI supply has come up a bit. There were some significant mints, and the DAI price peg has, I would say, gotten a little bit looser, although still centered around a similar level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This was expected. It took a lot longer than expected. But I think as ETH prices come down, to some extent, people have seen that as attractive again in terms of levering back up on ETH, and using DAI as a method of doing that. It is interesting to note that this time, unlike before, it didn't completely floor the DAI price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

But I think the takeaway here is decreased collateralization ratio, and increased supply. People are comfortable taking a little bit more risk at the current ETH price levels, and at the current stability fee. The combination of those two things, just naturally, you would expect a little bit more leverage seeking behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Can we assume that, all things being equal, if the peg appears to be stable, should we be lowering the stability fee as a best practice in order to see how close to destabilization we can get? It sounds like a bit of a leading question, but I'm wondering if that might be some of the behavior we're seeing in the voting, the maker, voter, holders, are voting, is that they're attempting to make the rate as competitive as it possibly can without destabilizing the peg again. Is that possibly what the behavior we're seeing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

But I do think that naturally, I would expect people to vote down the stability fee when they see the DAI price peg is stable, because ultimately, they don't want to be paying that higher cost to use Maker, if they don't have to. So I think it's a first order level of thinking, but it's not necessarily wrong, in that it is better for the system to be cheaper, as long as the system is functioning properly.

I tend to ask you unanswerable questions, so I'm mostly looking for your opinion, I think. Matteo, you have your finger on this kind of pulse with your DIPOR, right? I think there's some overlap here, because, in my opinion, and I'm willing to be corrected, that MakerDAO is essentially setting the upper bound for the DIPOR right now. Is that what you're seeing Matteo? And do you think that, perhaps, voters are lowering these stability fees for potentially self-interested reasons, but also in order to increase competitiveness across the other lending platforms?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I think it would be quite interesting to look at the overlap between MKR holders and DAI holders, because if there is significant overlap, then I guess you'd expect MKR holders to be voting for a lower stability fee. But if there isn't, then that line of thinking doesn't quite add up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So that supply has basically stayed flat, but collateral drop is due to a drop in ETH value. Well, mathematically, the collateral ratio will drop when ETH price drops, but what we've seen is that, at least within a four or five day time scale, after ETH makes a significant price movement, people tend to move the collateral ratio back to what they're comfortable with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

What I've started to do actually, is to pull in more information on what's going on on those other platforms. I can start to compile. There are some graphs on this existing, but compile the total collateral between Maker and the other lending platforms.

It actually came down to around 9%, but was floating around 12 to 13%, which is, again, a slight discount off of the compound rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Even with the stability fee coming down, that growth has sustained at a semi-linear level, which is interesting, because you would expect ... it is slowed down a little bit, but you would expect, essentially, as Maker becomes cheaper, fewer people take loans out on secondary platforms, because more people would want to get it from Maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This is a complex discussion we've been having over the course of a couple months is, what is the nature of the relationship between the Maker stability fee, and the borrow rates on these secondary platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

They fall into this position of being naturally lower. Some folks have raised a concern of, should it be lower? Do we expect that this is a stressed state? And in the long run, will it come out to its secondary lending rates are higher? That was a question that we raised. I gave a lot of reasons why I don't think that's the case, and why I think this is the natural trend. But it's an important component of the overall picture as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It will then have an impact on what the secondary lending rates are. Right now, these secondary lenders are operating in a bit of a vacuum. I think one thing to definitely watch out for is how that evolves when DSR comes along.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You're saying that it would effect the stability fee, and thus effect the activity on the secondary lending platforms. I think it would inherently effect the activity on the secondary lending platforms, even if there was no change in the stability fee, because those secondary lending platforms are effectively functioning like a makeshift DSR pulling supply out of circulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

To me, this is an iterative process. If we take the moment aside of a formerly verified smart contract. Just ignore the contract for a moment. Issuing DAI from a CDP, or borrowing DAI via somebody else's contract, if you were to exclude the formal verification risk, they're just substitutes, so it's just turning it into an efficient market where they compete with each other to try and, in effect, allow somebody who has debt to refinance their debt for a cheaper interest rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's just a competing market force.

The question is, why hasn't it happened faster? It's the same reason, and I don't know if you know this, but on Netflix, if you subscribe in Netflix in Turkey, even using an American credit card, if you VPN there, it's $9 a year. It's $20 a year, versus \$20 a month. It's just a substitute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Rather, it will anybody who wants to buy DAI and just lock it in a contract, thus removing the similar supply. To me, they're just substitutes, is my point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

What I do want to stress is, I agree with these secondary lending platforms are primarily a destruction of inefficiency. There's this oversupply that exists and is basically, what we talked about prior. Let's say organic demand is the 70 million DAI. But the actual supply floating out there is 80 million. The amount that gets refinanced to secondary lending platforms is ... should economically just be eating into that 10 million. It's just a marginal, makeshift efficiency lever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

There's not really much else to go through, other than the iteration of this, and the PID work that's been continuing in the background by Alex and Vishesh. Alex, I don't know if you want to mention any of the work you did, but definitely keep going on it.

It's basically, if you think about it logically, as being a snowflake with the very center core being single-collateral DAI. The moment we start branching out little pieces of that snowflake being a component of, let's just say, commercial real estate is one, or mortgage lines are another, or rep, or some other token being another aspect off of a branch of that snowflake. The question becomes, from a risk management, how do we manage the PID? How do we manage the algorithms to track that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I definitely want to get to talking about community involvement and what you guys can contribute, and what we can hope to expect from the community. Then, if we get to it, we can talk a little bit about challenges for some of these risk models. But as I said, these are just vague topics to discuss in the coming weeks. As always, any questions anybody has, please interrupt and ask. This is fairly unstructured.

What are we concerned about? I think a good place to start is CDPs. CDPs are the building blocks of the MakerDAO protocol. I think, understanding exactly how CDPs can be modeled is probably the most crucial aspect to the entirety of collateral risk. Essentially ... so CDPs are what? Loans that users issue to themselves based off of their collateral, using the MakerDAO protocol, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I think the first step is defining exposures, who is exposed to what kind of risks? And what do they have to be concerned about? In this case, the exposure risk of the CDP comes down to this notion of solvency and liquidation risk of the CDPs. What we want to note is, one, what is the probability that this CDP is liquidated or gets paid back on time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is important why? Because when we are assessing the risk of a giant portfolio of CDPs, we want to have an overview of what these losses could potentially be, how bad they can get. That will play a factor in determining how much total exposure MakerDAO can facilitate. Essentially, the two topics are, what is the likelihood of CDP default or CDP liquidation?

In practice, we're going to explore a number of different approaches and basically we will find out that we're going to need to come up with some pretty clever pragmatic approaches to how we handle that.

Then, furthermore, we're also interested in the distribution of the events where the collateral hits this threshold. For example, if a CDP is liquidated, is it likely because it's just dipped a few bucks below its liquidation price, or there's been some sort of massive catastrophe, and the ETH price has cratered entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Right? Stability fees in this context, I'm talking about credit spread or credit premium for this risk.

The way I look at it is the stability fee so far has been a charge on the CDP holders for expanding the DAI supply. CDP holders, they issue DAI. They need to pay a cost in order to help DAI remain stable as it permeates the Dfi economy.

Long story short, the stability has to reflect what our expectation of these liquidations are, the frequency and the severity. How we go about doing that is a couple different approaches. This is really where things get a little bit difficult. We can start with academic frameworks, and then work our way down to the pragmatic solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

As we all know, the bad CDP liquidations end up incurring bad debt for the MakerDAO protocol, and there are some various mechanisms to clean up that bad debt. That comes at the expense of MKR holders through the dilution. It MKR holders are bearing that risk, then you can think of that risk premium on the collateral as a break even point where that compensates for a dilution risk. Essentially, the notion of CDP liquidations is concerned with dilution risk, and that dilution occurs when you have really bad price movements in the collateral assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Right now, we can look at previous CDPs and see that every CDP that's been liquidated thus far has not incurred any bad debt. Every CDP has been an orderly liquidation process, and there hasn't been any dilution to PETH holders thus far. This is part of the challenge, because if you were to just look at historical performance of these CDPs, one might look at these at the current collateralization ratio and say, " This is great. We're totally safe from everything. We've had, I don't know, a couple hundred liquidations and they've all been great." In fact, the collateralization cold be argued to be too high. But in reality, we know that that's not the case, and we can foresee potential risks that don't manifest themselves in the historical trading markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

You could look at Tether over the past seven years and say, "This is the safest collateral in the market today." But intuitively, we know that there is some looming risk where it crashes down to zero. If you were to look at the distribution of CDP liquidations related to Tether, you'd really see not very many liquidations until just a massive surge of them where they all lost everything, assuming that there's something bad with Tether. Probably shouldn't single them out, but you guys get the point. Yeah, how can we reason about these risks that don't necessarily manifest themselves in the trading history, or in the market's profile, a collateral asset? This is a big part of the qualitative assessment of these collateral assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I like to think of our role as governance facilitators here as stepping into do the analysis that MakerDAO as this abstract pseudo autonomous protocol cannot do on its own. Primarily what MakerDAO cannot do on its own is the qualitative assessment of collateral types, which is one of our primary functions as risk managers and here on this governance call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Essentially, what we're going to see is a carefully laid out process on how we think is a good way to evaluate collateral assets that looks at them from the correct lens, and helps us evaluate some of these risk characteristics, essentially these analyses will work their way into the credit risk premium. Any questions so far before I get into qualitative assessments? Is this too fast?

Let's assume for a second that regardless of how quickly an asset moved up or down, how volatile it was, that you could liquidate the entire collateral at spot with no slippage. Doesn't matter what the asset is. As soon as it hits the liquidation price, you can just dump all of it. In that case, no matter how risky the asset is, you could just set 100% collateralization ratio, because you could just dump it as soon as it hits the threshold. The only remaining risk is this jump risk where it just shoots over that threshold where you actually can't dump it. It essentially just goes straight to zero. That's the extreme edge case. But what we care about for the credit risk and a stability fee is that jump risk where it literally just blows through your thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Every time you tried to sell 1000, you'd take that much slippage. Then you might want to, I don't know, put a collateralization ratio that is at 150%, so as soon as it hits the liquidation price, by the time you're finished signing the collateral, you've just broken even. The collateralization ratio, I like to think of it as this metric of expected slippage, or expected liquidation amount during the auctions. It's slightly unrelated to the default risk or the liquidation risk of the CDP as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Consider slippage and things like that, [inaudible 01:09:52] with all liquidations, not just the [inaudible 01:09:58]. In that case, market risk does translate into [inaudible 01:10:05] asset, but how would collateralization of that asset overall responds to those market risks matters? Because if you consider ETH today, versus even four or five months ago, there's a completely different risk profile on Maker, because Maker holders, even though DAI supply has come up, have continued to increase the margin and hold more collateral per DAI. It's almost like the fundamental behaviors have changed. People have gotten maybe more risk averse, or maybe they've learned. It's hard to say why this has happened, but the fundamental risk profile is methodically different now, because if ETH dropped 30% today, you'd be far less likely to result in any bad debt than you would have four or five months ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This concept of changing risk profiles to MakerDAO is going to be another key aspect here, is that different asset price environments for our collateral portfolio leads to a different distribution of the way CDPs look. You can define a CDP through the amount of debt it has, through its collateralization ratio, and etc. Different market environments lead to different CDP distributions, which will necessarily require different primaries and risk approaches, depending on what we're trying to achieve. That's going to be a governance issue, I think, though. In theory we can know how we would want to handle different risk profiles. Actually, executing it through governance is going to be a different question entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Essentially, when we are considering a new collateral type, well, the first consideration is how does that collateral type even appear on our doorstep? I think we have to come to consensus on some sort of generally agreed upon onboarding approach. I think it's probably not a good idea to just have any one person or one entity just come and submit a bunch of collateral types for you and say, "Here, this is what you should even look at." That presents some interesting challenges, too, in a same sense that, along with the governance polls, in terms of trying to come to consensus of how to even run certain aspects of the polls, we could run into certain situations here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I don't think there's a great answer for that today, given that we haven't gone through that process yet. But let's assume we have a few different collateral types to evaluate. I think there needs to be some sort of a prioritization methodology for how we order them and decide to discuss them. I think this can be weighted by the perceived safety of the collateral, just at a high level, probably want to filter out the more unsavory collateral types. I think there should also be some weighting given to the potential of DAI being generated from the collateral type. Obviously, we want to go after high value collateral first. Then potentially, also some determination of how uncorrelated it is with the rest of our portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

That's not something that can be formally defined. But I would say maybe given equivalent levels of perceived safety, I think some sort of potential, I guess, stability fee generation could be a way to determine that. Anyways, this is all at a very high level. This is under the situation where we could all of a sudden have 200 collateral types in the queue. Unfortunately, the governance call does not afford enough time to go through all that, at least not in its current iteration. Of course, I think we'd all like to see as many collateral types being supported as possible. But for the short term, I think we can have some sort of quick order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I think the okay process for evaluating collateral types starts with a three step process, first step being classification of the collateral, second step being a due diligence, and third step being a risk analysis. I'm going to just quickly run through these three steps. One of the most important determinations is are these collateral assets ... they are bearer assets or not? I think that's the primary aspect we're concerned with when it comes to classification. I think ... actually, does everybody know what bearer assets are in this context?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Bearer assets are essentially if you owning the asset comes without any counter party risk, such as owning physical gold or Bitcoin or Ether. This is important in this context of liquidations and trying to sell off the collateral asset. Currently, with the way Ether works, it gets purchased by the keepers and the liquidation aspect is done and we all move on. But potentially with security tokens or any sort of non-bearer asset, we have to keep in mind what the recourse process behind that looks like if we're to expect this orderly and efficient liquidation process. I think first step, really, with collateral asset is just classifying it. What kind of asset is it? Furthermore, bearer assets can be subdivided into the different crypto asset models that we're all familiar with, governance tokens, work tokens, utility tokens, all that kind of stuff. Then registered assets or security tokens, they can be whatever, equity tokens, bond tokens, and so forth. Next step would be to do a due diligence. Due diligence requires just a careful examination of the collateral asset and everything that's associated with it, looking at the team, looking at the technology, looking at the business line behind it, looking at the token, style, [inaudible 01:20:00], so forth, all the nitty gritty [crosstalk 01:20:02].

This goes aligned with the due diligence. But essentially, our goal here is to uncover anything that might cause a sudden crash in collateral asset value, simple example being a protocol risk or bug exploits and so forth. For example, due diligence report covers shoddy code or shoddy coding practices, then you might obviously assign a larger risk to this collateral asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

That qualitative assessment will work its way into the risk premium by virtue of trying to determine the likelihood of repayment of these CDPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We're already at the half hour, so I'm going to spend the rest of the time trying to flesh out community involvement a bit. We've definitely discussed, I think, a broad range of topics so far. I think first step for anyone looking to get involved is identify which factors are most interesting to them, because there's a significant amount of work to do both on the qualitative side of things and on the quantitative side. Just naturally, people have expertise in various areas. If you're looking to get involved in the quantitative side of things, anything with risk modeling and evaluating market trading history and all that stuff, is definitely a lot to do there. Then on the qualitative side of things, I think first step is definitely just working on onboarding collateral types, how we plan on bringing them to our attention and how we start talking about them. Then eventually, I think hoping to see just analyses written up and presented to the community on the Rocket Chat or on a subreddit, and we can share those on the governance call and discuss them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I know I keep saying that. But unfortunately, documentation takes longer than the research and just talking about it on the governance call. We're trying to get a jump start on the discussions, because the documentation itself is not quite ready. But I'll try to release a few high level outlines of the process on the Rocket Chat maybe later today or tomorrow. Any questions?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I'm glad to see that we started into the weighting into the collateral risk area, so thanks for that, Cyrus. Thanks, Vishesh, for your graphs as usual, and thank you everyone else, Matthew, Matteo, and everyone else who jumped in for discussions. Please continue the chat in our subreddit. Lots to go over. Lots to discuss. We can keep the thread going till next week. All right.
