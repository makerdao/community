My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of Community Development. I have a few things that I like to say at the top of each call, and I'm going to continue to say them. I've posted a link in the group chat. It's a link to our discussion thread. So, every week we have these calls. These calls last for an hour, an hour-and-a-half. We talk about a lot of really interesting things. Too many interesting things to actually dig into each one of them, so we continue these discussions in our subreddit, and we also post summaries of the calls there, for people who weren't able to attend, which are wonderfully detailed and recently have included pictures as well, so if you want to get caught up, if you want to get people caught up with the things that you've said and asked, follow that thread because we post summaries, and the conversation continues.                                                                       |

If you have access to a microphone, please just jump in and ask questions whenever they occur to you. We're pretty good about handling interruptions. If it turns out that we're in the middle of a flow though, we'll circle back afterwards, but we love the back and forth, so please speak up if you have something to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It rarely ends up being that efficient. Happily, today though, everybody is spared that because I've been racking my brains to think about what I can talk about, and I probably shouldn't be looking for reasons to waste time in these calls, so here's the short answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For the last three or four weeks, the voters have signaled for no change. The stability fee seems to be doing what it's supposed to do. We have a large, longer-tail conversation about whether the cadence is correct, whether the stepping is correct, whether we should ... there are 10 or 15 various tweaks that we could talk about for governance. Those conversations about how we could change governance lasted for a while, and it's probably going to be superseded by an improvement in the governance portal, which will make some of these debates moot, so I'm not going to dig back into those today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Think we'll start off with the monetary policy stuff from Vishesh, and then we'll jump into the next phase of collateral risk. Pretty simple. Vishesh, are you on the call?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

So, all in all, it's been a pretty interesting week, I think. Just to touch on the state of the peg real quick, it's been fairly steady. There's been kind of a slight drift, and a slight increase in variance over the past month or so, but nothing to be worried about, and I think this was part of the discussion around, that spread is easier to widen when the stability fee is lower, because there's a little bit less pressure, and I think that's something we can double click on later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It seems that there is some profit booking from ETH rising, which is really interesting, because actually, there's a little bit of a time delay on this graph, the time cut-off was at around 14 million. Since then, the trading volume has come up to about 16, almost 17 million, and DAI price is actually slightly higher than this now, so I'll just show that real quick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I think a fair amount of selling ETH for DAI. There was some back and forth in the sense that in the past few hours, with the drop in ETH price, we had some liquidations, fairly decent sized, and so when those liquidations happen, you have some of that sale of collateral as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

DAI is not as much of a glass draw as it had been in the past, and so even in the large selling periods, the DAI price doesn't shoot up quite as dramatically as it had in the past, and then in those selling periods, it also doesn't seem to crater as much as it had in the past. So both good indicators for the stability of DAI, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

There's a lot more depth to the order book, so the price moves in more granular increments, and so I think you tend to see this graph fill out a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The ETH price has been consistently rising. There was that sudden drop just kind of overnight, and I think what we'll see is with that sudden drop, again, the was liquidations, a little bit of a boon for DAI price, but not much change overall. What's interesting is generally when there's that profit booking happening, you'll see a commensurate decrease in DAI supply, or at least a commensurate rise in collateralization ratio, because people get scared of those liquidations, and they punch in a little bit more collateral, but also the price went down, so in nominal terms all the collateral decreased in value as well, so those kind of balance out, where in the extremely short term you would see a bit of a drop in collateralization, and then you will see it rise up as a counter effect.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It's up to 86.4 on here, but in reality it's up to about 87 million right now. So, what's really interesting about that is there were a ton of transactions, both on the minting and burning side, as well as the liquidations that were going on, so just a ton of activity in general, in the past 24 hours. And actually in the past week, there's been a fair amount of activity in general.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Then the next day there was a million that was minted, and relatively little burned, and then in the past 24 hours, about three million-plus minted, and then about two million wiped. So even though, net, the supply has not changed dramatically quickly, it is a consistent increase.

Whenever I see large wipes, I always go on DaiStats.com and check out the burner, and I know that if the burner didn't increase by a lot of MKR, that that huge amount of wiped debt is very short-term. Do you think that that's something that's useful in any way?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

But I actually will touch on that just now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

What we saw was the age of open debt was consistently decreasing, so a lot of new debt being created, and a fair amount of old debt being paid back. That had slowed as of the 16.5% increase, but with the past few days, what's been going on with ETH price, there hasn't been that much more old debt being paid back, but there has been a fair amount of new debt being created. So that does kind of actually touch on your question, David, which is, it has been a fair amount of new debt getting paid back, but we can actually look at the fees a little bit later on as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So if I zoom out here, actually, what you'll see is there had in the past been a more dramatic increase in both, right? So as the DAI supply was growing, there was sort of a consistent amount, and it actually seems to be a trend, where there's this steady state of how old debt gets before it starts to get paid back, is how I would interpret it. That has consistently persisted, and it had slowed down recently, except in the past three weeks, I would say, there was a bit of an uptick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It's interesting, is it only goes up, basically, which makes sense, because in the earlier days, it's a new system, and so all the debt that's being paid back is probably new, while ... presumably this doesn't go up forever, right? We haven't seen periods, except for really tiny ones, where the thing has gone down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So, I would not expect the closed debt age to decrease for quite a while, and actually theoretically, and I have to double check on this, but I think it could continue to increase without ever needing to decrease, in the sense that if the DAI supply continues to grow, the average age could just level out, for debt getting paid back. It doesn't necessarily have to decrease. That would be if it hits this equilibrium, steady state. But it is interesting-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Right as we hit that 19.5, it starts plummeting, and as I'm interpreting that, DAI is circulating in and out, and circulating out at a much faster rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

One, yes, higher-stability fee really, I think, lit a fire under a lot of people, and prompted a lot of repayments. Some refinancing, but I think a fair amount of repayment of old debt, which is what you really want to see out of the system. If you saw this open DAI days just continually rising, that's in some sense an accrual of risk, or at the very, very least a delaying of revenues for Maker holders, which is not good.

The timing of the 19.5 stability fee, it's correlated to the bullishness of CDP holders, so it's kind of, to me, what I saw in the increasing stability fee was one of the first leading indicators of a bull market, or rising ETH price. The stability fee was a proxy for the sentiment of the people, so those things are going to be correlated, I think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So, one of the interesting things is the stability fee also has an impact on what happens with secondary lending, and so to some extent, you saw an increase from maybe two million DAI being supplied on secondary lending platforms to about 14 in that same sort of time span. This is a shorter time span graph, but it's still that May to June period. And then you saw the amount of DAI being borrowed on those platforms as well rise to about 11-and-a-half million from basically nothing, maybe one-to-two million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

And I do want to touch on the fees in a bit, I'll pull that out, but also you do see this interesting pattern of a continual accrual of unpaid fees, and some periodic jumps in fees getting paid back. And there appears to be a bit of periodicity emerging, in terms of when fees get paid back, when new CDPs get opened, when old CDPs get closed out. Almost on a monthly cycle, but it's a little premature for me to be guessing trends like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

So what's interesting is during that same time frame of this run up, we saw far fewer draws happening on new CDPs versus old, so more of the debt that was being pulled out of Maker was being pulled out of preexisting CDPs, and presumably because the overall outstanding loan amount was continually increasing during that time, that more of those new loans were coming from secondary lending platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I think as the ETH price has continually been rising over time, people have perceived this greater height to fall from, and so they've kept a little bit more collateral in the system. What's interesting to note is in the past 24, 48 hours, a ton of collateral has been freed from the system. This is not even with liquidations and such, but also people have pulled out some collateral. And that tends to happen when the ETH price goes up, because presumably as the stability fee was reduced, 17, 16, around here, this 450-ish level was something that people were presumably comfortable with. As ETH price continued to rise, that number just ran up from ... you know, simple math?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Now, I'm guessing with the drop in ETH price, you'll see the opposite trend, where people will counter the drops in the liquidations, and you'll probably see this go back up, but I don't want to call my shot too early on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The secondary lending platforms, as I showed, the total borrow and supply volumes both have run up since the ... and they've been running up for the past week or so. The borrow has outpaced supply a little bit, and so those rates have come up a little bit. Actually, I can show that graph.

Sorry, for borrow. For supply, it's generally been lower, so that's an interesting little tidbit. The supply rates do tend to flip-flop a little bit more than the borrow rates, but the weighted average of the amount that is being lent on those platforms, and what the rates are, has run up a little bit in the past week to almost touching the stability fee, and then at times, dYdX has run over it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

But what's interesting is the supply volume running up on those volumes, because when you see a fair amount more debt being drawn out of MakerDAO, and you see a fair amount of DAI for ETH trading, some people I guess are either paying back those loans or writing them off, booking the profits, ignoring the fees, and then perhaps that DAI that's getting purchased by people is being lent out on those platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Today we're going to talk a little bit more about tackling stability fees and expected losses. Just as a reminder where we are in the overall process, we're obviously doing the quant modeling.

We talked a bit over risk rating from our due diligence report. We still haven't seen what to do with that yet. We talked a little bit about how the risk premium as attached to a CDP is some function of its loss distribution, and expected loss being the average, or mean, of that loss distribution. That expected loss is itself a function of the probability of default of a CDP, the severity of the loss given default, and the amount of actual debt attached to a CDP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And what we are going to look at today is how to essentially think about the collateral asset, how to think about behavior, and then how to package everything up together into calculating the stability fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

So in general, credit risk is a pretty hard problem, mainly due to the randomness of these underlying assets, right? Anybody who claims to know what ETH is going to do, come talk to me on the side. But nonetheless, there's a lot of different approaches and ideas and models, in how to gain some understanding of the underlying asset. Probably too many to cover today, or certainly in 30 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

How has a certain asset behaved in the past? And as we all know, past behavior does not indicate future behavior, but it's certainly a good starting point, and in practice, due to just the difficulties, it's often just used as a substitute, and then you can try to analyze how good it behaves over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They want to issue some debt. One way to calculate the probability of default for such a company is to just look at all companies in that sector over the last 50 years, right? So you have 1,000 companies in the energy sector, and 20 of them defaulted. Well, maybe 2% is a fairly good starting point for what you expect the company that you're looking at is likely to default on its debt. And then from a similar analysis, you can also calculate its potential losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

From these ratings, you can often derive the metrics that you're looking for. So, interesting question is, does this work with CDPs? Can we just look at CDPs over the past year-and-a-half, right? There's been some thousands of CDPs and some hundreds of liquidations, and just take a ratio and say roughly 5% of CDPs are likely to default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So in the first example, we're talking about decades of data versus just a year-and-a-half, and we can certainly use it as a starting point, but probably in and of itself, not sufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

My preference is to start with an academic model, because it, in my opinion, helps build up a lot of the intuition behind this stuff. Talk a little bit about why it's not so great, see what we can save, improve it, iterate it and just kind of keep doing this over and over again. So in some ways, today's presentation does not reflect the reality, but they might, so let's see. Let's just dive right into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Collateral asset price, we'll just call it A. The t subscript is of course the time, so basically the price of ETH over time. And CDP owners lock up a certain amount of collateral value, which is the price of ETH times the quantity of ETH that they lock up. We'll call that collateral value V. They draw K debt, they pay a stability fee, s, and maintain a collateralization ratio of V over K, which we'll call X. We'll also define the whole space of user behavior just by F for now. We're probably not going to talk too much about user behavior today, because I don't think we'll have time, but essentially we have to account for the fact that users, as I mentioned, can add or subtract collateral or pay down or draw more DAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

They'll either pay back debt or they'll add collateral. And this is just important for modeling. Essentially, the probability of the CDP being liquidated changes over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Just talked about this. The debt is a function of the stability fee, time and user behavior. So stability fee and time, what I mean by that is the accrued stability fees over time, and the user behavior is whether they are drawing or wiping DAI. All right, in addition to standard user behavior of trying to avoid liquidations, there are some technical edge cases as well, in particular the oracle security module, which has a one hour price feed delay, so essentially if the collateral asset just completely plummets, users are incentivized to draw as much DAI as possible, since the collateral's worthless anyway, so we need to be cognizant of this as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

But it's helpful to just assume a one-year, forward-looking period. Somewhat arbitrary, but also fairly standard, and it doesn't really change analysis too much. And we know that CDPs default when they hit the liquidation ratio L, and this notation here at the end is basically saying, the first instance at which the collateralization ratio crosses the liquidation ratio is when default occurs. We'll call it T1, which is kind of arbitrary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

A CDP is liquidated with probability Q, and so this is the probability that that T1 threshold is reached before our one-year time horizon, so this is definitely something critical that we're interested in. And we know that this probability depends on the evolution of the collateralization ratio, which in turn depends on the value of the collateral and the amount of DAI debt, which in turn depends on this stuff we talked of before, asset pricing, user behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Somewhat arbitrary variables. This represents loss given default, or one minus loss given default. And as we all know, this represents the slippage adjustment for when you liquidate the collateral. The less slippage there is, the higher amount of the debt that you recover. And then of course we have this amount offset by the liquidation penalty as well, or I should say, added back in. r is the risk-free rate, from traditional world. Plays a role. And our credit spread, which is essentially what we're solving for, is defined by s minus r, and we'll ignore DSR adjustments for now. And the expected loss of a single CDP, which is what ultimately we're trying to solve for here, is the product of these three variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

So we already know we want to solve for probabilities, losses and exposure amounts, and we need to develop some intuition around the asset price and user behavior. Standard approach to modeling an asset price is to apply what's known as a stochastic process, which we'll talk about in a second, and it just helps us understand the asset in a variety of ways. It's not perfect, but it's fairly standard and it has quite a history behind it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Vishesh and Alex have done a lot of great work in this area, and I hope, I think, we'll be able to explore that a little bit later as well. And in some instances, you can just look at user behavior correctly, and maybe even bypass collateral assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I think there are advantages and disadvantages to both, and in some cases we can even do a hybrid. To clarify that a bit, if you think about that corporate debt example I used a few slides ago, it's not always easy or even possible to actually model the underlying assets that is behind debt. Sometimes you can only just look at it from the debt level, and try to model how the debt behaves over time, or historically, or in some cases, such as our CDPs with ETH, you can actually model the underlying asset, which I think gives us an advantage. But there could very easily come a time where the collateral that is put into CDPs is just a representation, right? It's not something that can be modeled directly, or easily. So it's interesting to have different approaches in mind.                                                                      |

And I'm going to impose a bunch of assumptions right now, and then relax them slowly, because it's a lot to do it all at once. So I'm going to ignore user behavior for now. The ability for users to add or remove collateral at will at any time, and to add or subtract DAI at any time, makes things really complicated. It causes a lot of headache. Just adds a lot of complexity, which is what makes MakerDAO such an awesome protocol, right? It's extremely flexible, but it becomes a little bit difficult to analyze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So essentially, as soon as liquidation is triggered, you can recover everything. Constant risk-free rate. Constant volatility. And volatility here is a historical volatility, based off of the trading history. Returns are normally distributed. I'll get into it. That is for next slide. No early liquidations, which seems like a silly assumption, and asset price cannot gap up and down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Basically, if you assume that the collateral asset behaves a certain way, you can do interesting stuff with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In every small time increment, it will move a little bit in accordance with its historical mean, plus some random component that is scaled by the volatility. And that random component is quite literally just ... almost think of it as an RNG. Essentially, you can simulate thousands of different price paths per collateral asset, where each price path is a potential likely simulation for the evolution of this asset price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

One is, as I mentioned, we can calculate the frequency of the paths which end up below our threshold, which will help us determine the probability distribution, and actually at the same time, we can just calculate how much loss each particular path is associated with, and essentially knock out two birds with one stone here. Kind of, those two metrics come together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

So, first assumption that we can relax is no early liquidations. That's kind of an easy one to get rid of, and here we can kind of see the same style of model, but essentially as soon as the paths breach the threshold, liquidation is triggered. And that's more in line with the model that we're used to. This green one should not have an arrow too that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

And so we've modified our process a little bit by adding a jump variable, which essentially means that the asset price can gap up or down at any random moment, and this Y variable here, this dY, is essentially what's known as a Poisson process, which essentially means that you know a event will occur with a certain frequency, and then the goal is to try to calculate what the frequency of that event occurring is, and with what size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

What was the magnitude of the moves?" and so forth. And then going from there. So that's some interesting research we've been doing on the side.

And essentially, even without it, with just the trading data, we could have actually calculated everything up to the stability fee, but that's not necessarily very reflective of reality, and the easiest example for that would be the ETH versus some fiat-backed stablecoin, which everybody knows has a chance of having a sudden plummet, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So right now we have thousands of CDPs, each with their own debt, their own collateral, their own liquidation price, and we can't do a full simulation one by one for CDP. It's just not feasible. So what we would have to do is take distribution of CDPs and model them as a whole. And that's been a lot of the work that we've been doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Of course this would require modeling the actual collateralization ratio as opposed to the asset, which is just a few small tweaks. Still a lot of research to do, in terms of sharpening our corners, but we're getting there for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

They'll pay back 105 in a year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

So, essentially what I'm trying to get at here is that ... let me get the ... so, we have this risk-free CDP, and we have a CDP here that looks more like our actual CDPs, and that difference here is this chart here in the middle, which, if anyone has picked up on the clues, this whole presentation is very reminiscent of standard options theory.

So another way to explain this is, right now as a CDP owner, you may ... let's say you were the counterparty to the CDP owner. You have that downside risk, where if the collateral value drops below the amount, then you would start to accrue losses, and those losses, which is what we've been trying to calculate so far, resembles that of a put option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Definitely a good amount of complexity here, and a good amount of assumptions. In particular, the log normal distribution of the asset price, which is what underpins the stochastic model, underprices the tails, and that's how you end up with outsized moves that you don't expect. It's potentially not great for assets that don't have a lot of historical data, and in many ways, looking at empirical models would be better in some regards, because I think it could have a better tail distribution, but as I've mentioned, it doesn't necessarily factor in the right qualitative risk characteristics, so I think some ideal blend could be combining the empirical with some sensible, qualitative risk adjustment, and then, interestingly enough, there is also a thing called "expert models," where you can just defer to somebody who claims to know what they're talking about, but we won't be doing that one, unless you guys want Rich to just determine all the risk parameters by himself. |

If people have questions, they want to absorb some of this stuff, surface it in the chat at the side. I guess this is the slight segue to talk about signaling and debate, and these deeper discussions, because this is a path that MakerDAO is going to be heading down more and more as the world and crypto gets more complicated, particularly in the governance calls and particularly as we begin to shift focus more towards risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I thought it would be interesting to discuss. As a quick reminder, or refresher, there is obviously some risks involved with not increasing the debt ceiling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

We've constantly been debating the fact that we have a limited number of levers in this ecosystem. The lever that's been exposed right now is the stability fee. There was a lot of back and forth, a lot of very considered discussions about whether we should be playing with more levers than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We fixed things as a community with the stability fee, but the market conditions have changed. Inventory levels presumably have recovered to healthy levels. Secondary lending platforms have arisen to take some of the pressure off of us. We are no longer in an extended bear market. Well, maybe it just started in the last hour again, so who knows? But up until today, we weren't in an extended bear market, so maybe it's time to actually start looking at the fact that raising or tweaking the debt ceiling might actually be a valid option at this point, because we're not adding insult to injury, and we're not trying to disguise the fact or overcompensate for supply and demand issues. We actually have a healthy ecosystem that could potentially demand a higher debt ceiling.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But obviously I think the thing to think about is we know we don't want to hit the debt ceiling. I think that's fairly agreed-upon. We can debate that if not, but I think the question is, what is the likelihood that we hit the debt ceiling? What is the downside of having the debt ceiling be slightly higher if we're not going to hit it? Which I think is relatively low. And in what scenario should we worry about the debt ceiling?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I'm basically unpacking your question, Rich, into four or five. But I think some of the answers are pretty clear, which is, okay, let's assume we don't want to hit it. Let's assume there's relatively low risk in increasing the debt ceiling if we are not going to hit it. Now, the one caveat is, if the debt ceiling is increased and somebody goes ahead and aggressively votes down a stability fee, that's your risk scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Because in the scenario that stability fee is artificially depressed or inflated from external market factors, and those external market factors change, like, oh, I don't know, a sudden drop in ETH price, then you might be worried about people deciding to lever up, DAI price potentially taking a hit, and us deciding, "Hey, we need to react and make a change to the stability fee." So that kind of reactionary behavior in response to market forces is riskier when there's a higher debt ceiling, because then you-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

You're trading one risk for another, and the risk that you are reducing is the risk that you hit the debt ceiling, and you have to work harder to unwind some of the negative effects that get bubbled up from doing it, so the risk that you are gaining is the risk that the governance process lets a fox into the henhouse, reduces the stability fee and somehow somebody decides to bully the situation and overnight mints a bunch of DAI, either crashing the DAI price or creating a whole bunch of other negative effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Is that the idea?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

One is, to the extent that there is a 14-million float on secondary lending platforms in terms of DAI supply, that reduces the fear that you should have of hitting the debt ceiling. The more excess supply sits on secondary lending platforms, the less worrisome it should be that you're nearing the debt ceiling, because that's kind of your buffer range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

But, that being said, I think it's a good conversation. I think it's worth raising. It's something we should think about soon, and on the flip side, what I'm saying is if you do decide to increase the debt ceiling, then you've got to be a hell of a lot more careful about decreasing the stability fee, because even if it's all quiet for a week or two, or a month even, and nobody prints a massive amount of DAI, if the stability fee is lowered, it just increases your susceptibility to that kind of an event occurring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You want to leave enough. You don't want to have so much of a buffer where you make the debt ceiling 500 million and the current outstanding DAI is 80, and if you lower the stability fee, you're just taking unnecessary risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

And so the stability fee I actually look at as kind of like a speed adjustment, so when the stability fee is higher, the supply moves slower, in terms of in response to demand, and when the stability fee is lower, it moves faster. Now, it's also not just demand, but also moves faster and slower in response to ETH price changes, so the one caveat I would say is it doesn't necessarily have to be this malicious, rogue actor or whatever. It could just be ETH, and ETH could be our rogue actor, and make significant price changes, drop to 260, whatever, I don't care, and cause a bunch of different people to act on behalf of market forces, which is basically the same effect as a rogue actor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

In multi collateral DAI, to some extent that's going to shift away, and it should shift away. So changing the underlying risk premium for a specific collateral shouldn't be the method to control supply and demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The changing the stability fee doesn't necessarily solve your problem, right? So even if you hit the debt ceiling, you jack up the stability fee. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to solve the underlying friction that you run into from hitting the debt ceiling. So let's say the stability fee was 14, 13%. You hit that debt ceiling because somebody minted a bunch of DAI. People can continue to source DAI, theoretically, from secondary lending platforms, to the extent that that supply exists, but if you increase the stability fee, you may also reduce the supply that exists on those secondary lending platforms, and you may not necessarily reduce the DAI supply. It sort of depends on what the rates are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

And this is where I think some people have voiced some frustration, that the stability fee is a bit of a blind instrument. Totally true. The stability fee works well when the relative rates on other platforms are two to three percent lower, let's say, or there's a decent buffer range. If they started to run up to be equal to the stability fee for some reason, or even higher, then increasing the stability fee might not solve your problem at all, and so it's a really complex kind of problem, and so I would caution away from thinking that if you hit the debt ceiling, okay, just jack up the stability fee and that will fix everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

But the risk premium for it, it's going to get set by a risk team member. It'll be modified, maybe, weekly, but its condition's based on the risk of the collateral package as a whole. It shouldn't have anything to do with the price, as it relates to the price of DAI. It should only be risk-driven, and risk-driven to the point where this collateral package as an aggregate, as compared to the whole, should be viewed in effect as being riskless. In effect, an insurance wrapper around a collateral, of whatever that type is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Conditions on the ground that drive the risk, and Cyrus's comment about putting and energy company, and putting their debt as a function of collateral, conditions on the ground of oil prices go to \$5 a barrel. Okay, there's a high chance that company might default. The risk premium should get adjusted accordingly. But that still doesn't change anything to do with ... it shouldn't have anything to do with the price of DAI yet.

I think the greatest concern of the entire project is how to maintain the, call it tranches, packages, whatever the mnemonic will be, that those risk premiums are priced consistent with the risks compared to the system, and that they maintain the exponential nature of the risk that they actually have. If we start having too much apathy towards that, and just a little bit of ignoring the conditions on the ground, and I'm not picking a crypto token. I mean, the price of oil, the price of real estate, you name it. We start getting lax on that, and the whole project can implode on itself, and that's what is very dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I mentioned that we've been having these discussions. So, we talk about governance all the time inside MakerDAO, and we get to talk about it publicly for an hour on Thursdays, but one of the most often-requested, floated or suggested future plans for governance is that the reality of the situation is that not everybody in our ecosystem is either willing, able or has the time to be deeply engaged and weigh all the evidence, so people are keen for delegates, or some kind of a delegation system, or some kind of mechanism where we identify people that are trusted-enough to make some of these high-level decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

That they get together, they surface, they collect the data, they create the models, they present their frameworks and then the community ratifies those. And potentially, as that ecosystem, or as that model, expands and gets more refined, then we can start applying that to other things, so maybe there's a utility token tranche, the administration team or something. There's all kinds of options available to us, but very reluctant to have the Foundation airdrop that onto the ecosystem.

That is literally what the whole system is designed to do. So if you go back and, I recommend that people do this, is read the Foundation governance risk framework that Steven published for us, or you can just skip to the third one, but that's what it's all about. We do scientific governance and risk. This entire framework is designed for that first iteration of gradual decentralization, is that we have risk teams who are deep into the science and the history of this world. They present models and ideas and datasets, and then the neophytes and the amateurs like me are in a position to read all that stuff and figure out whether we have confidence in those systems, and then we vote them in or we vote them out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I hope that we've been good about this message, is that I can't really iterate strongly enough how interested, how focused, MakerDAO is, the Maker Foundation is, on decentralization. That's our core principle. In order to do that responsibly and effectively, we need to do that in steps while we understand how the process works, and the first process, the first step, in that was the interim risk teams, and the decentralized risk teams, which are coming on board soon. We're going to iterate and evolve that process, and then keep on identifying skilled groups of stakeholders, and figuring out whether we need to split out the different groups, or have different venues for deeper discussion, or we identify some other class of actors in the system which we want to empower to start surfacing signals for us as well.                                       |

Yeah, no asset has normal returns, right? It's just a completely made-up assumption.

I mean, all derivatives are priced with a certain set of assumptions which in practice are extremely difficult to unwind. To relax that assumption would imply that you have some better distribution of what the asset returns look like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If you can do that, you don't need to look at any kind of simulation of a normal price path, or log normal price path. Now, it's not right, it's not going to be perfect, to be able to say, "Hey, I've got this estimation of log normal price path, and I'm going to assume that that's the case," right? We're not doing that either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

And then the way you're arriving at those outcomes is by saying within each of those iterations in that simulation, you've produced a log normal price path, because there's no better intermediate alternative.
