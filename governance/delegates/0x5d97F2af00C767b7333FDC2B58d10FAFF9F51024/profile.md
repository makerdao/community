# Sovereign Finance AVC

## Why Sovereign Finance?

Cryptocurrencies were created with the idea of returning the power of money to individuals. And we believe that MakerDAO should position itself and lead the growing financial revolution that enables autonomy, independence, and self-governance.

This voter committeeâ€™s central values will be:

**Growth and Adoption**: We will drive and support all initiatives that allow for massive growth and adoption of DAI while reducing risks associated with the protocol, particularly assets that could compromise its economic stability.

**Long-term Sustainability and Revenue**: We will support and promote all initiatives and proposals that develop reliable, secure, and revenue-stable products for the protocol.

**Security and reliability**: We will also be alert to potential points of excessive centralization that could affect the protocol. Allowing us to guarantee optimal security, thus transmitting greater security for DAI holders, partners, and participants in the protocol.

**Ethos and commitment**: We will actively contribute to the spread of DAI to all corners of Latin America and the world. Our ethos is aligned with the values of MakerDAO, and therefore our commitment goes beyond mere participation in governance.

**This CVC supports the vision and roadmap outlined in the Endgame towards decentralization.** We firmly believe that decentralization is a requirement that will define the success or failure of the protocol in the long term.

As an organization committed to the principles of decentralization, autonomy, and self-governance, we believe **that supporting public goods is a crucial component of creating a sustainable and inclusive financial ecosystem**. In this regard, we commit to preparing educational content that promotes MakerDAO and easily explains to MKR holders how to participate and involve in governance.

Regarding the dovish v hawkish dilemma, we prefer to go with a balanced strategy for MakerDAO that would aim to maintain stability while also promoting growth and innovation. By finding the right balance between these two objectives, MakerDAO could build a sustainable and successful platform that attracts new users and drives innovation in the decentralized finance space.
