## Delegate Statement

Hello everyone! We’re Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter), a leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently has over 50 members and we’re expecting many more next semester!

Penn Blockchain has committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business Development, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, etc.

Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet. Our internal voting process takes place on the weekends and is an equal weighted democratic process. Proposals that will expire before the weekend are debated on our internal messaging platforms with a majority vote being our overall end vote.

Other governance initiatives involve:
* Staying active within discussion forums
* Drafting new proposals when appropriate
* Staying up to date with protocols covered
* Discuss models and parameters with leading analysis companies like Gauntlet
* Communicating with internal team members
* Hosting speaker events with projects in conjunction with BD

We’d love to be your Maker delegate as many of us have been following Maker for years now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3. Members of our club are also actively working with the MakerDAO team internally on different projects, such as deploying a set amount of treasury assets in on chain initiatives.

When delegating with us, rest assured your tokens are in the hands of one of the most hardworking and determined Blockchain clubs out there. It’s a vote of confidence in University Blockchain clubs and we greatly appreciate your support. Finally, delegation with us is an agreement on our end to continue to do our due diligence and uphold quality and consistent work.

As always, thanks so much for your time and we truly appreciate your consideration.

### Possible Conflicts of Interest
* Penn Blockchain takes part actively in the governance of other well known projects
* This proposal’s author (juanbugeth on twitter) is helping internally with MakerDAO with possible on chain strategies for increasing treasury and liquidity for DAI

I have read and agree to abide by the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).

### Waiver of liability
By delegating to Penn Blockchain, you acknowledge and agree that Penn Blockchain will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.
