## Core Values
* Scaling
* Functionality

## Delegate Statement
With regards to Maker I believe two things: Maker has to scale and Maker has to function. 

Needless to say, Maker is not going to scale unless the organization is first functional. With functionality, I refer to directions that if left untouched will not damage Maker in the foreseeable future. It is a good-enough approach - not perfection. Accordingly, issues such as governance overhead and organizational focus have me worried. This is also why I believe we need to nurture softer aspects like community spirit and culture carefully. Building a community capable of continuously attracting talent is the goal.

With regards to scaling, I am an out-of-the-closet shameless enthusiast. When I refer to scaling I do not mean to settle for the slow organic growth of a few assets per month, I am talking about configurations capable of eventually handling thousands of collateral types per month.  Naturally, this is not doable with a system depending largely on human interaction which is why I am a big believer in things like automation, incentives, and staking.

## Conflicts of Interest
I hold other cryptos in addition to MKR, but the relative amounts are such that I do not think it will impair my judgment. If significant portfolio changes are made, I will notify the community.
