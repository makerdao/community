# Composable AVC

**What is the Composable AVC?**

1. **Community oriented AVC**, who will encourage the use of the permissionless joke contests to enable the $JOKE ecosystem to better understand, inform, and participate in governance proposals by surfacing feedback from a variety of participants
2. **Collaborative AVC,** who will actively seek out support and guidance from industry leaders and partners to compliment the knowledge inherently strong within the community
3. **Active AVC**, not only frequent meetings but proactive use of tools, and experimental processes will be leveraged to iterate quickly on how decisions are surfaced and communicated

**Composable AVC Values**

1. **Credible Neutrality.** Though the jokecouncil will instill a number of members to steward the AVC, our intent is to leverage the jokerace contests to surface feedback from all $JOKE holders and implement a practice of on-chain participation that extends beyond us. It is most important to us that the platforms provide a case study for fair, bottoms up participation.
2. **Low Ego, High Experimentation** As a governance participant in Maker, all should be respected and the jokecouncil AVC will prioritize learning and iterating over getting things right the first time
3. **Anon / Time zone friendly.** We will have a public AVC text place and frequently utilize the public, on-chain joke contests to surface ideas publicly and inform sync conversations within the designated meeting times

Because of our commitment to the Credible Neutrality principle of acting as a conduit for council members who vote in an entirely decentralized way via the jokeraces, we are neither Dovish nor Hawkish in nature.
