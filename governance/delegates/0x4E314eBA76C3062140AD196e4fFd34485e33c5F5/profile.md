### Core Values (Optional)

- Transparency/Openness. We believe in open lines of communication and transparency. We share our knowledge and embrace diversity of thought.

- Trust. We partner constructively and develop close working relationships. We actively listen to the community’s feedback and compromise to find solutions in effort to help the community realise its fullest potential.
- Integrity. We act honestly and ethically in all dealings. We reinforce a culture of doing what is right.
- Collaboration. We believe in achieving together and building trust as we strive to deliver the best in all that we do.
- Entrepreneurial Spirit. We adopt an ‘owner mindset’. We identify opportunities and we take the initiative to pursue new and innovative ways of delivering value.

### Delegate Statement

Governance House is a newly formed initiative founded by members of various DAOs, including Index Coop, Aave and others. The purpose is to help solve voter apathy and provide Metagovernance as a Service (MaaS) across DeFi. MaaS intends to enable all community members the ability to progress an idea from concept into implementation through decentralized governance processes. In doing so, we will utilize our extensive networks, deep DeFi knowledge, developer resources and voting support to progress community-backed improvement proposals to implementation.

Our grander vision is to become a collaboration hub, with members from many of the leading DAOs across the industry all coming together to support the growth of the ecosystem. We have been working closely with Index Coop and Aave DAO, and would now like to extend our expertise in governance to the Maker DAO community. We seeks to become an active participant in the Maker DAO community and to work with the community in supporting the adoption and expansion of DAI’s across the ecosystem.

With members who have executed more than 100 meta-governance proposals, we have a deep appreciation for community engagement and understands the nuances of DAO governance. We are committed to being an active, reliable and impactful delegates for the community. We will provide a high context with a unique perspective to Maker DAO in helping the community achieve its goals and document all our voting decisions.

Our votes will aim to support the growth and protection of the DeFi ecosystem and we will:

Support adoption of DAI across the DeFi ecosystem
Support encourages collaboration between the Maker DAO and other DeFi communities
Stand with the community against any proposals that can harm the DeFi ecosystem or MKR itself.
Post our own proposals that are aligned with the two items above.
We (Governance House) have read and agreed to the Delegate Code of Conduct.


### Conflicts of Interest

Governance House has holdings and/or voting influence in other DeFi protocols, is an active participant in those protocols and intends to be actively engaged with other DeFi communities. Governance House is pro-ecosystem and does not support anticompetitive values.

Some of our members are contributors in other DAOs and DeFi protocols, including Maker DAO.

Our members also hold tokens of other DeFi protocols, including MKR.

### Waiver of liability
By delegating to Governance House, you acknowledge and agree that Governance House and its members will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.
