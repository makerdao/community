## [Executive Vote] Increase the USDC-A Debt Ceiling, Whitelist tBTC on the ETHBTC Oracle - September 11, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Increase the USDC-A Debt Ceiling

As per this signal request [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-increase-usdc-a-debt-ceiling/4068), the USDC-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 40 million to 100 million if this proposal passes. This is an expedited change triggered by the increased usage of the USDC-A vault type coupled with the recent peg deviation and as a result of advice provided by a senior risk contributor.

Community discussion of this change may be found within the linked thread.

### Whitelist tBTC on the ETHBTC Oracle

As per the [MIP10c9-SP9](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnmzxuxgbjx2nxqhs7hjcqhtcwsdmj8wuxywci5m7prpv) poll that took place under the weekly cycle [tBTC](https://tbtc.network/) will be whitelisted on the ETH/BTC Oracle if this proposal passes.
