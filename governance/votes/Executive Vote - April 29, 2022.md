# [Executive Proposal] Core Unit Budget Distributions - April 29, 2022

The Governance Facilitator(s) and the Protocol Engineering Core Unit have placed an executive proposal into the voting system. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

If you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.

## Executive Summary

If this executive proposal passes, the following **changes** will occur within the Maker Protocol:
- A total of 1,057,918 DAI (itemized further down) will be transferred to multiple Core Units.
- A total of 9,758,130 DAI (itemized further down) will be streamed to multiple Core Units.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier which means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**. This is to ensure that at least some knowledgeable actors are available if issues arise with the new contracts deployed by this spell.

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol.

### DssVest and ESM Interaction

_This section clarifies the need for the above vesting streams to take place on a new DssVest contract_.

The DssVest DAI contract is being updated to prevent `vat.suck` calls being possible in the event of emergency shutdown. This involves including a check to ensure that `vat.suck` only works when the system is live for all new vest contracts. For existing contracts, the ESM will be relied to allow keepers to remove pause proxy permissions if governance becomes malicious after shutdown. Note that this is relevant only after shutdown occurs. All vest functionality remains the same as per the original contract. All existing streams are remaining the same, but the new streams are from a new contract.
