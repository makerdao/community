title: Executive vote - October 11, 2019
summary: Lower the Stability Fee by 1% to a total of 9.5% per year
---
The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com) which will enable the community to enact a new Dai Stability Fee of 9.5%.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

The need to lower the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, Oct 10. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) (delayed by 24 to 48 hours), and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to enact the rate determined by the [previous](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) Governance Poll.
