### Increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling

As per the recent poll prompted by the MakerDAO Risk Team located [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmp1mutxgaykgempxv5tvr3eu9paqzjwcd8bb9vvz9vyht), this proposal asks whether the ETH-A Debt Ceiling should be increased from 340 million to 420 million.

## Summary

- The ETH-A Debt Ceiling will increase from 340 million to 420 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
