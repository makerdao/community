## [Executive Vote] Onboard USDT and PAX, Multiple other changes - September 4, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Onboard USDT (Tether USD)

As per the non-standard weekly [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxm6bdgjqdwzzdueqcq6crplhrvdjlrnpcfk87y76rdtj) USDT will be added to the Maker Protocol as a collateral type if this proposal passes. USDT will be added with the following parameters, which match those in the linked poll.

- Risk Premium: 8%
- Liquidation Ratio: 150%
- Debt Ceiling: 10 million
- Auction Lot Size: 50,000
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
- Dust: 100 Dai

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. This means that the initial stability fee for USDT will be 6%.
