## [Executive Vote] Officially Ratify the MIP0c12-SP2 Subproposal for Onboarding a Second Governance Facilitator

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Core Personnel Onboarding - Add @LongForWisdom as an official Governance Facilitator](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmugi8agwf9nwhwdbdpbaszbchrwdggkykqhy5mz4x5flb)

This Executive Vote has an expiration of 4 days, after which it has no effect. MIPs and subproposals only move to the "Accepted" status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 4-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 4-day limit, the MIPs and subproposals have their status changed to "Rejected".

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review
