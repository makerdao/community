The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com), which will enable the community to enact a new Dai Stability Fee of **22.5%**.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-executive-voting)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/faqs/governance.md#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

The need to increase the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, July 18. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) (delayed by 24 to 48 hours), and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance/gnr) to inform your position before voting.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to enact the rate determined by the [previous](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) Governance Poll.
