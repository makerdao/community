## [Executive Vote] Enable TUSD, Reduce Stablecoin Liquidation Ratios, Other Changes - September 18, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Base Rate Increase

As per the weekly Base Rate[poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmabz1ezdmdmvshqjxmpw1geyjogz8npcb5hehk31bnb6w) the [Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-change-the-stability-fee-structure/2258) meta-parameter will be increased from -2% to 0% if this proposal passes.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

### Enable new TUSD Implementation

TUSD will be re-enabled with the following parameters, which are a combination of the linked poll and the linked signal request.

- Auction Lot Size: 50,000
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
