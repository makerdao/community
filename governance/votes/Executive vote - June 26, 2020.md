## [Executive Vote] Raise the Base Rate and the DSR, add KNC and ZRX as collateral types

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Add KNC as a Collateral Type](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmranqqaxjrhet8xorhkqtgki5mzxa1mizudoylcsrfapt)
- [Add ZRX as a Collateral Type](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmtq2u4vfakyk8mqkcdvclo6dqihims6smx1fvkru8m7sz)
- [Raise the Dai Savings Rate Spread from 0% to 0.25%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzvkijnqgwg8an3pyhy376glsfbqfelxgqcpbnswqwx82)
- [Raise the Base Rate from 0% to 0.25%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyyuvc3fphgt9bqotkedijxt5mpnjfktz/3je9c2cspfae)

Note: The Base Rate adjustment will set the following Stability Fees:

- ETH-A: **0.25%**
- BAT-A: **0.25%**
- USDC-A: **1%**
- USDC-B: **50.25%**
- WBTC-A: **1.25%**
- TUSD-A: **0.25%**

The DSR will also be set to **0%**

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
