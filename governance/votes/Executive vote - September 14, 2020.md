## [Executive Vote] Changes to USDC-A and PAX-A Parameters, Reduce Box Parameter - September 14, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol. This expedited executive vote is taking place due to an [emergency signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-take-emergency-action-to-fix-the-peg/4096) put forward by the Maker governance community. Discussion of this executive vote can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/expedited-executive-vote-2020-09-14/4125).

### Changes to USDC-A and PAX-A Parameters

As per this [emergency signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-take-emergency-action-to-fix-the-peg/4096), the USDC-A and PAX-A vaults will see changes (summarized below) to their parameters if this proposal passes. Note that the parameter changes are a combination of this original signal, and input from risk contributors and the Governance Facilitator.

### Reduce Box Parameter

As per this [signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-change-box-ttl-auction-parameters/4023) and input from risk contributors and keepers, the `box` auction parameter will be reduced from 30 million to 15 million if this proposal passes. This change was originally planned to take place next Friday after an on-chain poll, but it was deemed urgent and included in this expedited executive proposal.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- The USDC-A collateralization ratio will be decreased from 110% to 103%.
- The PAX-A collateralization ratio will be decreased from 120% to 103%.
- The USDC-A debt ceiling will be increased from 100 million to 200 million.
- The PAX-A debt ceiling will be increased from 5 million to 30 million.
- The Vat global `line` parameter will increase from 823 million to 948 million.
- The `box` parameter will be changed from 30 million to 15 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
