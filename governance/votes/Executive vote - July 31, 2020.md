## [Executive Vote] Reduce the Base Rate, Whitelist DyDx on the ETHUSD Oracle

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Reduce the Base Rate

As per the weekly Base Rate[poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmpvqs7gycpjdcpwbye4twvwxuhf4ax2tvt6i1pto5qd2p) the [Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-change-the-stability-fee-structure/2258) meta-parameter will be reduced from 0% to -4% if this proposal passes.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

### Whitelist DyDx on ETHUSD Oracle

As per the [MIP10c9-SP5](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmvzjogrmxzih4qphszuowutqnm1th4c5mstwqetpv1vnx) poll that took place under the weekly cycle [DyDx](https://dydx.exchange/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD Oracle if this proposal passes.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:

- The Base Rate meta-parameter will be reduced from 0% to -4%.
- The WBTC-A Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 2% to 0%.
- The KNC-A Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 4% to 0%.
- The ZRX-A Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 4% to 0%.
- The USDC-A Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 4% to 0%.
- The USDC-B Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 50% to 46%.
- The MANA-A Stability Fee parameter will be reduced from 12% to 8%.
- [DyDx](https://dydx.exchange/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD Oracle.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
