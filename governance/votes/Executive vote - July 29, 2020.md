## [Executive Vote] Increase the ETH-A, USDC-A, USDC-B, W-BTC, BAT-A debt ceilings

The Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.



## Increase the ETH-A, USDC-A, USDC-B, W-BTC, BAT-A debt ceilings

The Risk Team has requested that the debt ceilings be raised as an emergency measure due to the recent pressure on the Dai peg.

The Risk Team has called for the following changes:

* ETH-A debt ceiling to be increased from 260 to 340 million.
* USDC-A debt ceiling to be increased from 80 to 140 million.
* USDC-B debt ceiling to be increased from 10 to 30 million.
* W-BTC debt ceiling to be increased from 20 to 40 million.
* BAT-A debt ceiling to be increased from 3 to 5 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
