## [Executive Vote] Approve Monthly Governance Cycle Bundle, Increase the ETH-A debt ceiling

The Governance Facilitators have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

## Monthly Governance Cycle Bundle

As per [MIP3: Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md), this bundle consists of the proposals that have met the prior requirements to be included in the monthly MIPs executive. These proposals are as follows:

**Maker Improvement Proposals**

- [MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3008)
- [MIP18: Meta-Parameter Adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3118)
- [MIP19: Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3098)

**Sub-Proposals**

- [MIP18c4-SP1: Subproposal for Modifying Meta-Parameter Adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3119)
- [MIP12c2-SP3: Domain Work Requirements for the Onboarding of MANA](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3139)

## Increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling

Additionally, the Risk Team has requested that the ETH-A debt ceiling be raised as an emergency measure due to the recent bullishness of ETH (Ether) with the aim of maintaining the Dai peg.

The Risk Team has called for the ETH-A debt ceiling to be increased from 220 to 260 million.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive passes the following will occur:

- Move MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle to Accepted status.
- Move MIP18: Meta-Parameter Adjustments to Accepted status.
- Move MIP19: Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade to Accepted status
- Implement changes to the Maker Protocol contracts as detailed in MIP19.
- Move MIP18c4-SP1: Subproposal for Modifying Meta-Parameter Adjustments to Accepted status
- Modify MIP18 according to the content of MIP18c4-SP1.

- Add MANA to the Maker Protocol with the risk parameters attached to MIP12c2-SP3.
- Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling from 220 to 260 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
