### Stability Scope Defined Parameter Changes

As per the [Stability Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104), and the [adjustments to the base rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-2-non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-may-2023/20981/7), the following parameter changes will be made, if this executive proposal passes:

#### [Dai Savings Rate (DSR)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-dai-savings-rate) Increase
- Increase the DSR by 2.49% from 1% to **3.49%**.

#### [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) Increases
- Increase the ETH-A Stability Fee by 1.99% from 1.75% to **3.74%**.
- Increase the ETH-B Stability Fee by 0.99% from 3.25% to **4.24%**.

### Non-Scope Defined Parameter Changes

As per [this poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQXhS3Z), the following parameter changes will be made, if this executive proposal passes:

#### RETH-A Parameter Changes
- Increase the RETH-A [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) by 30 million DAI from 20 million DAI to **50 million DAI**.
- Increase the RETH-A [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) by 2 million DAI from 3 million DAI to **5 million DAI**.
- Increase the RETH-A [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) by 2.99% from 0.75% to **3.74%**.

#### Other [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) Increases
- Increase the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Stability Fee by 2.49% from 1.75% to **4.24%**.
- Increase the WBTC-A Stability Fee by 0.9% from 4.90% to **5.80%**.
- Increase the WBTC-B Stability Fee by 1.4% from 4.90% to **6.30%**.
- Increase the WBTC-C Stability Fee by 0.65% from 4.90% to **5.55%**.

### USDP PSM [Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling) Reduction

As per [this poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQYSLHH), the following change to the USDP PSM Debt Ceiling will be made, if this executive proposal passes:
- Reduce the USDP PSM (technical name PSM-PAX-A) Debt Ceiling by 500 million DAI from 500 million DAI to **zero DAI**.

*Technical implementation note:* to achieve this, the USDP PSM will be removed from the Autoline (DC-IAM) and have its Debt Ceiling set to 0. However, the [Global Debt Ceiling (`Line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-global-debt-ceiling) will not be reduced at the same time. This is to leave a suitable buffer to prevent a situation where the total Dai supply exceeds the Global Debt Ceiling, which would prevent new Dai from being minted.

### MKR Vesting Transfers

The following MKR vesting transfers will be made, if this executive proposal passes:

#### Sidestream Core Unit

As per their [approved budget](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP44), **348.28 MKR** will be transferred to the Sidestream Auditor Wallet at [0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1f950a51516a697E103aaa69E152d839182f6Fe).

*Note:* the distributed amount has differed from the initial estimate due to Sidestream [repricing](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp44-adding-sidestream-auction-services-core-unit-mkr-budget-sas-001/10802/7) their vesting plan. It remains within the overall approved cap.

#### DUX Core Unit

As per their [approved budget](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP27), **225.12 MKR** will be transferred to the DUX Auditor Wallet at [0x5A994D8428CCEbCC153863CCdA9D2Be6352f89ad](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5A994D8428CCEbCC153863CCdA9D2Be6352f89ad).

*Note:* the distributed amount has differed from the initial estimate due to additional hires. It remains within the overall approved cap.

### Spark Protocol [Dai Direct Deposit Module](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit) (D3M) Parameter Changes

As per [this poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWatYqy), the following Spark Protocol D3M parameter changes will be made, if this executive proposal passes:
- Increase the [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) by 15 million DAI from 5 million DAI to **20 million DAI**.
- Increase the [Target Availible Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) by 15 million DAI from 5 million DAI to **20 million DAI**.

### Spark Protocol Proxy (`SUBPROXY_SPARK`) Authorization

As per [this poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmc9fd3j), a Spark Protocol Proxy will be authorized by this spell to allow parallel production of executive proposals covering Spark Protocol. This will allow the Spark Protocol team to prepare code separately, but any changes will not be active until triggered by a Maker Core executive proposal.

If passed this executive proposal will:
- Give the Spark Proxy admin access on Spark Protocol.
- Add the Spark Proxy to the [Emergency Shutdown Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown/emergency-shutdown-module).
- Trigger the Spark Proxy spell actions listed below.

*Technical implementation note:* The Spark Proxy will be given admin access by calling `ACLManagerLike(SPARK_ACL_MANAGER).addPoolAdmin(SPARK_PROXY)`. The Spark ACL Manager address is [0xdA135Cd78A086025BcdC87B038a1C462032b510C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdA135Cd78A086025BcdC87B038a1C462032b510C) and the Spark Proxy address is [0x3300f198988e4C9C63F75dF86De36421f06af8c4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3300f198988e4C9C63F75dF86De36421f06af8c4).

The Spark Proxy spell address is [0x41D7c79aE5Ecba7428283F66998DedFD84451e0e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41D7c79aE5Ecba7428283F66998DedFD84451e0e#code).
