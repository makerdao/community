### Increase the LINK-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQtn7UY?network=mainnet) governance poll, the LINK-A debt ceiling will be increased from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the MANA-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSCLfXN?network=mainnet) governance poll, the MANA-A debt ceiling will be increased from 250 thousand DAI to 1 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the BAT-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmW4ei2M?network=mainnet) governance poll, the BAT-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 10 million DAI to 2 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the TUSD-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXTGwq4?network=mainnet) governance poll, the TUSD-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 135 million DAI to zero DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-manage-tusd-exposure-due-to-ownership-change/5821) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfTU85J?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, a mandate exists for increasing the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling to the value of 500 million DAI. Given the risk posed by new code (even after audits), the non-Foundation mandated actors have been pursuing a gradual increase to this target value. That policy continues as a part of this proposal. If this proposal passes, the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 30 million DAI to 80 million DAI immediately, and it will increase linearly over the next 12 weeks to its target of 500 million DAI without intervention from Maker Governance. This gradual increase will be achieved by using the `lerp` module developed by community contributors.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/road-to-the-psm/5353/85) thread for discussion and details on the development of the PSM.

### Increase the Debt Floor(`dust`) Parameter

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWPAu5z?network=mainnet) governance poll, the Debt Floor (aka `dust`) parameter will be increased from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI for all non-PSM vault-types if this proposal passes. 

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-dust-parameter/5963) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Vault Compensation Working Group Payment

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQcXFeC?network=mainnet) governance poll, 12,700 DAI will be distributed to members of the Vault Compensation Working Group as remuneration for their work on the ultimately unsuccessful Vault Compensation Proposal if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-vault-compensation-working-group-payment/5562) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this action.

### Whitelist Instadapp on the ETHUSD OSM Oracles

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmNSb2cu?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, [InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD OSM Oracle if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c9-sp26-subproposal-to-whitelist-instadapp-gelato-automation-contract-for-eth-usd-oracle-access/5901) application thread for more details on this action.

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire and will have no effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.
