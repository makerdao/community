## [Executive Vote] Approve August 2020 Governance Cycle Bundle

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

## August 2020 Governance Cycle Bundle

As per [MIP3: Governance Cycle](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP3/mip3.md), this bundle consists of the proposals that have met the prior requirements to be included in the monthly MIPs executive. These proposals are as follows:

**Maker Improvement Proposals**  
None present.

**Sub-Proposals**

- [MIP0c13-SP1: Subproposal for Core Personnel Offboarding](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP0/MIP0c13-Subproposals/MIP0c13-SP1.md) ([Discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip0c13-sp1-subproposal-for-core-personnel-offboarding/3508))
- [MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP13/MIP13c3-Subproposals/MIP13c3-SP1.md) ([Discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip13c3-sp1-declaration-of-intent-forward-guidance/3130))

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive passes the following will occur:

- [MIP0c13-SP1: Subproposal for Core Personnel Offboarding](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP0/MIP0c13-Subproposals/MIP0c13-SP1.md) will be moved to Accepted status.
- [MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/RFC/MIP13/MIP13c3-Subproposals/MIP13c3-SP1.md) will be moved to Accepted status.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
