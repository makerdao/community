The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team will place an Executive Vote proposal into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/) to enact a new Dai Stability Fee of 7.5%.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-executive-voting)) will begin on Friday, March 22nd at 5 pm UTC and will continue until the number of votes surpasses the previous Executive Vote total. This will be a [continuous approval](https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdao-governance-risk-framework-part-3/) vote.

## Review

The increase to the Stability Fee was discussed in the [Governance call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0D39p2lNBc) on Thursday, March 21, and ratified by the community in a formal [Governance Poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/raise-the-stability-fee-by-4-to-75-per-year). Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0D39p2lNBc), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/ep-24-governance-and-risk-meeting?in=makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts), and the online [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkrgov/comments/aw7toy/are_there_arguments_for_a_stability_fee_increase/) to inform your position prior to voting.

Key factors under consideration for increasing the Stability Fee are:

* Exchange price persists below $1
* High inventory levels among market makers and prop desks
* No attributable impact from the previous Stability Fee increases

## Analysis

An examination of the available data strongly suggests a Stability Fee increase is warranted. The exchange price of Dai across several major exchanges has been consistently hovering in the $0.96 to $0.99 range for two months. Decentralized exchanges with sufficient volume/liquidity also confirm the same discrepancy.

Below is an average price chart of the Dai trade history.

Informal discussions with several large Dai market makers have suggested that inventory levels have run high, and balance sheet capacity has diminished. Informal polling through various community channels has also shown strong support for an increase.
