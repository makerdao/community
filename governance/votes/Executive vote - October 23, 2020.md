## [Executive Vote] Increase the Surplus Buffer, Oracle Whitelisting - October 23, 2020

The Governance Facilitator and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Increase the Surplus Buffer

As per the on-chain governance [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmY74kHx?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown), the System Surplus Buffer will be increased from 2,000,000 DAI to 4,000,000 DAI if this proposal passes. 

Further details and discussion on this change can be found on the governance forum in [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-the-auction-surplus-buffer-by-2m-system-surplus-october-2020/4716) signal request thread.

### Whitelist B.Protocol on the ETHUSD Oracles (Medianizer + OSM)

As per the on-chain governance polls for the [OSM](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWsrcK4?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) and [Medianizer](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmeviuFH?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) oracles, [B.Protocol](https://www.bprotocol.org/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD Medianizer and OSM oracles if this proposal passes.
