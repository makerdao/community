## [Executive Vote] Increase the Base Rate

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Increase the Base Rate

As per the weekly Base Rate[poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxsvxuukus5ngdfy4wcysbrzr1j3gens8o8axfkdheoca) the [Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-change-the-stability-fee-structure/2258) meta-parameter will be increased from -6% to -4% if this proposal passes.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- The Base Rate meta-parameter will be increased from -6% to -4%.
- The USDC-B Stability Fee parameter will be increased from 44% to 46%.
- The MANA-A Stability Fee parameter will be increased from 6% to 8%.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

Community debate on this topic can be found on the MakerDAO [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/).
