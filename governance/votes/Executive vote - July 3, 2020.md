And in this forum thread:

- [[Signal Request] USDC-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3020)

Therefore, voting for this Executive will:

- Add multiple Oracle Feeds
- Raise the USDC-A Stability Fee to 1% to 4%
- Raise the USDC-A Debt Ceiling from 10 to 40 Million
- Raise the WBTC-A Stability Fee from 1% to 2%
- Raise the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling from 10 million to 20 million
- Lower the Base Rate from 0.25% to 0% which, in conjunction with the Base Rate change, will set the following Stability Fees:
  - ETH-A: **0.0%**
  - WBTC-A: **2%**
  - BAT-A: **0.0%**
  - KNC-A: **4%**
  - ZRX-A: **4%**
  - USDC-A: **4%**
  - USDC-B: **50%**
  - TUSD-A: **0%**

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
