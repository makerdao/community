The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote.
