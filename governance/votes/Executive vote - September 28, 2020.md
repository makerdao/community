### LRC Collateral Onboarding

LRC will be added to the Maker Protocol as a collateral type if this proposal passes. LRC will be added with the following parameters, which match those in the linked risk evaluation with the exception of recent generic modifications to the Dust and Auction Lot Size parameters.

- Risk Premium: 3%
- Liquidation Ratio: 175%
- Debt Ceiling: 3 million
- Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Dai
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
- Dust: 100 Dai

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. This means that the initial stability fee for LRC will be 3.25%.

The risk evaluation for LRC can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/lrc-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/3549).  
The smart contracts evaluation for LRC can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/lrc-erc20-token-sc-domain-team-assessment/3471).

- Debt Ceiling: 7 million
- Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Dai
- Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
- Bid Duration: 6 hours
- Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
- Liquidation Penalty: 13%
