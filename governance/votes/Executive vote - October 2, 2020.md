## [Executive Vote] Raise the PAX-A Debt Ceiling and Decrease the Base Rate - October 2, 2020

The Governance Facilitator and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### PAX-A Debt Ceiling Increase

As per this community [signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-paxusd-a-debt-ceiling/4263), the PAX-A debt ceiling will be increased from 60 million to 100 million if this proposal passes.

### Base Rate Decrease

As per the weekly Base Rate [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyb7u8vpk7n4xtd6wacvhzx6hk9tszrze7b91ya1cd15z) the [Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-change-the-stability-fee-structure/2258) meta-parameter will be decreased from 0.25% to 0% if this proposal passes.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

### Whitelist TUSD Token Contract Upgrade

As per this forum [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/tusd-smart-contract-update-request/4445) and the response from the Smart Contracts Domain Team, the new TUSD Token contract implementation will be whitelisted for use in the Maker Protocol if this proposal passes.
