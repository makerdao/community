## [Executive Vote] Add ETH-B Vault Type - October 16, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alteration to the protocol.

### Add ETH-B Vault Type

A new vault type, ETH-B, will be added to the Maker Protocol if this proposal passes. ETH-B will be added with the following parameters, which match those in the previous governance [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzvcsx9lkpejp8xpxsvkvvfot8anarmdq17afjdbbu3wu). ETH-B will use ETH (Ether) as collateral.

* Stability Fee: 6%
* Debt Ceiling: 20,000,000
* Liquidation Ratio: 130%
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 6 hours
* Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* Dust: 100 Dai

Further details and discussion on the ETH-B vault type can be found on the Maker governance forum [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-add-eth-b-vault-collateral-type-september-2020/4435). 

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- ETH-B will be added as a vault type with the parameters listed above.
- The Global line parameter will increase from 1,456 million to 1,476 million due to the addition of ETH-B.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.
