The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com), which will enable the community to enact a new Dai Stability Fee of **12.5%**.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

The need to decrease the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, September 12.
