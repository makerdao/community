## [Executive Vote] Increase ETH-A Debt Ceiling - November 27, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling

The Risk Domain Team is [proposing](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/executive-vote-2020-11-27-eth-a-increase/5354) this increase to the ETH-A debt ceiling due to the combination of the recent bullishness of the crypto space and the coming governance contract migration which will prevent non-emergency changes to the protocol for 1-2 weeks. Please see the linked thread to see the rationale behind the change in more detail. The ETH-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 490 million DAI to 590 million DAI if this proposal passes.

Additionally, a community [signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-eth-a-debt-ceiling/5315) was in progress for the same issue.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- The ETH-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 490 million DAI to 590 million DAI.
- The Global line parameter will be increased from 1,481,750,000 DAI to 1,581,750,000 DAI.

The [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote.

## Review

Community debate on these topics can be found on the MakerDAO [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). Please review any linked threads to inform your position before voting.
