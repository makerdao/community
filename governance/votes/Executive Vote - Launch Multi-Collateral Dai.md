## [Executive Vote] Executive vote - Multi-Collateral Dai Launch

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to enact the collection of system parameters needed to activate Multi-Collateral Dai.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

Please note: Due to an internal delay in the code, **this vote cannot be activated earlier than Monday, November 18, 2019, at 4 pm UTC**, even if the community ratifies it earlier. This mechanism has been put in place to allow the ecosystem time to coordinate MCD launch-related efforts.
