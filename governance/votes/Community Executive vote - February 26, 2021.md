## [Executive Vote] Rates Updates, UNI-V2-DAI-USDT Onboarding - February 26, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance community. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

### Stability Fee Changes for ETH Vault Types

Given the successful outcome of the mid-February rates update [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWN699J#poll-detail), [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) parameters will be increased for ETH-A and ETH-B vault types if this executive proposal passes. ETH-A will increase from 4.5% to 5.5% and ETH-B will increase from 7.5% to 9%. 

Further details and rationale can be found in the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mid-month-rates-changes-proposal-19-feb-2021/6660).

### Lower PSM-USDC-A Fee Out (`tout`)

Given the successful outcome of this [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRchZFD?network=mainnet), the PSM-USDC-A fee out (`tout`) parameter will be decreased from 0.1% to 0.04% if this executive proposal passes. For more information on the `tout` parameter review the [Peg Stability Module](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-psm) documentation.

Further details and rationale can be found in the signal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-lower-psm-usdc-a-tout-parameter/6447).

### Onboarding UNI-V2-DAI-USDT

As per this [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfQAWop?network=mainnet), UNI-V2-DAI-USDT will be onboarded as the vault type UNIV2DAIUSDT-A if this executive proposal passes. UNIV2DAIUSDT-A will be initialized with the parameters shown below.

* [Stability Fee](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee): 4%
* [Liquidation Ratio](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio): 125%
* [Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling): 3 million DAI
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 6 hours
* Max Auction Duration: 6 hours
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* [Debt Floor](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-debt-floor): 2,000 DAI

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
* The ETH-A Stability Fee parameter will increase from 4.5% to 5.5%.
* The ETH-B Stability Fee parameter will increase from 7.5% to 9%.
* The PSM-USDC-A Fee Out parameter will decrease from 0.1% to 0.04%.
* The UNIV2DAIUSDT-A vault type will be added using UNI-V2-DAI-USDT as collateral with the parameters listed above.

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire and have no effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.
