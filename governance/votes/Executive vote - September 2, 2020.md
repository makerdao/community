## [Executive Vote] Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling - September 2, 2020

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling

As per the forum poll [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-forum-poll-raise-the-eth-a-debt-ceiling/3927) the ETH-A Debt Ceiling will be raised from 420 million to 540 million if this proposal passes. Note that this change has been expedited by the MakerDAO Risk Team due to the current and projected usage of the new yEarn ETH vault.
...

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- The ETH-A debt ceiling parameter will be increased from 420 million to 540 million.
- The ETH-A debt ceiling increase will increase the Vat global `line` parameter from 588 million Dai to 708 million Dai.
...

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
