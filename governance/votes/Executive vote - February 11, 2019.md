title: Executive vote - February 11, 2019
summary: Raise the Stability Fee by 0.5% to a total of 1% per year
---
The Maker Foundation Risk Team will place a proposal into [the voting structure](https://vote.makerdao.com/%EF%BB%BF) to raise the Dai Stability Fee by 0.5%, for a new rate of 1%.

As discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, February 7, primary reasons for increasing the stability fee are:

* Dai inventory has remained well above our threshold level of supply for just over a month and a half.
* The effective exchange rate for Dai has been generally below the $1 peg over the same time period.

The proposal will be placed into the voting structure for an **Executive Vote by Tuesday 2/12/2019.** Given that the proposal amasses the requisite votes the proposal will then be implemented and deployed to the system.
