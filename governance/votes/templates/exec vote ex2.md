- 2,000,000 DAI will be transferred to 0x3C5142F28567E6a0F172fd0BaaF1f2847f49D02F.

### Spark Proxy Spell Execution
As part of this executive proposal, a Proxy Spell for Spark Protocol at 0x443f3f4328553f5f85dFc0BA3D59969708201E14 will be triggered if this executive proposal passes.

This Proxy Spell includes the following changes to Spark Protocol:

#### DAI InterestRateStrategy Update
A new DAI_interestRateStrategy will be implemented to tie the borrow rate of Dai to the ETH-C Stability Fee. At present, the Spark Protocol DAI borrow rate is tied to the DSR set by the Maker Protocol. When the EDSR is activated, this would cause the Spark borrow rate to increase to 8%. The Stability Scope specifies that fees are not impacted by the EDSR and should be calculated as before. The ETH-C stability fee equals the underlying DSR, making it an appropriate reference for Spark Protocol.

#### Spark Protocol Parameter Changes
Per this successful governance poll, the following parameter changes will be made to Spark Protocol.

- DAI market Loan-To-Value (LTV) will be decreased from 74% to 0.01%.
- DAI market Liquidation Threshold will be decreased from 76% to 0.01%.
- The WETH market Reserve Factor will be decreased by 10% from 15% to 5%.
- The WETH market varialeRateSlope1 will be decreased by 0.8% from 3.8% to 3%.

Please review the forum post for more information about these changes.
