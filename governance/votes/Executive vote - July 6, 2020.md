## [Executive Vote] Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an **unscheduled** Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol as outlined in this forum thread: [[Signal Request] ETH-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3059).

Therefore, voting for this Executive will:

- Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling 20M to a new limit of 160M

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

These changes were discussed in the most recent Governance call. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-calls), and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to determine whether it will enact the changes established by the previous [Governance Polls](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling).

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your MKR in support of implementing the changes outlined above.**
