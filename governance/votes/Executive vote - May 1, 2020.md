The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Add WBTC as a Collateral Type](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnjrmznpnc9vczzdbuhhua4r3e1gtee5r1ar2yrjhyb82)
- [Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 6% to 0%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmc9jj1dyycrmft3pe1yyq6zzz8xdjxzw1gxqzkaogiawe)
- [Officially ratify the initial 13 MIPs and 2 Subproposals](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyqqe9guqfld2ge9rskly9jxycctgua8j6kevf5dhlnta)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
