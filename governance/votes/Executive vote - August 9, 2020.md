## [Executive Vote] Fix the WBTC-A debt ceiling

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Fix the WBTC-A debt ceiling
Unfortunately, a minor bug in the previous spell contract resulted in the WBTC-A debt ceiling being reduced to approxmiately zero DAI instead of being increased to 80 million DAI which was the original intent. This executive proposal will increase the WBTC-A debt ceiling from approximately zero to 80 million DAI as was originally intended.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:

- The WBTC-A Debt Ceiling will increase from approxmiately zero to 80 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
