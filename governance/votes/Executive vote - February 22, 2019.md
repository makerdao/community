# Increasing the Stability Fee

The Maker Foundation Risk Team will place a proposal into [the voting structure](https://vote.makerdao.com/%EF%BB%BF) to raise the Dai Stability Fee by 0.5%, for a new rate of 1.5%.

The increased stability fee was discussed in the [Governance call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&feature=youtu.be) on Thursday, February 21. Key factors under consideration for increasing the stability fee are:

* High inventory levels.
* Exchange rate persists below $1.
* No attributable impact from the previous stability fee increase.
* Additional future increases at potentially greater magnitudes.

The proposal will be placed into the voting structure for an **Executive Vote at 16:00 UTC Friday February 22, 2019.** Given that the proposal amasses the requisite votes the proposal will then be implemented and deployed to the system.

To participate in future Governance calls, please join us every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.
