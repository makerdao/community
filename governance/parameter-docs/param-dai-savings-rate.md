## Description
The Dai Savings Rate is a tool that Maker Governance can use to adjust the interest rate paid to DAI holders who have deposited DAI into the DSR contract. Maker Governance directly controls the Dai Savings rate.

The Dai Savings Rate is usually expressed as a percentage and can be set to any value. However, while Governance can set the Dai Savings Rate to a negative value, this will not affect the balances held within the DSR as they cannot decrease; this is because the `drip` function will revert if negative.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Dai Savings Rate is to enable Maker Governance to encourage DAI holders to deposit DAI within the DSR contract. Higher amounts of DAI within the Dai Savings Rate should reduce the market supply of DAI and act as upwards pressure on the DAI peg.

## Trade-offs

Increasing the Dai Savings Rate is a trade-off between increased DAI demand and decreased DAI liquidity and may also result in increased expenses for the Maker Protocol.

Decreasing the DAI Savings Rate will decrease the expenses of the Maker Protocol but may simultaneously reduce DAI demand.

## Changes
Adjusting the Dai Savings Rate parameter is a manual process that requires an executive vote. Changes to the Dai Savings Rate are subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

In essence, a higher Dai Savings Rate results in upward pressure on Dai price, and a lower Dai Savings Rate will reduce this pressure.

**Why increase this parameter?**

The primary reason for increasing the Dai Savings Rate is to increase DAI demand. This increase in demand is achieved by encouraging DAI holders to lock their DAI in the contract - thus removing it from the market, which should create upwards pressure on the Peg. Therefore, raising the Dai Savings Rate should be considered if DAI is trading below the Peg.

Increasing the Dai Savings Rate should make DAI a more attractive asset for holders than other stablecoin assets and help integration with the Maker Protocol, for example, if other DAPPs with stablecoin holdings deposit to the Dai Savings Rate to earn interest.

**Why decrease this parameter?**

The primary reason to decrease the Dai Savings Rate is to reduce DAI demand. Reducing the Dai Savings Rate should result in less DAI locked in the contract and increase DAIâ€™s supply on the market. In addition, it may be advisable to decrease the Dai Savings Rate if DAI trades above the Peg to reduce upwards price pressure.

Maker Governance may also wish to decrease the Dai Savings Rate when The Maker Protocol experiences a drop in revenue. If Maker Governance does not reduce the Dai Savings Rate when income falls, the Maker Protocol could encounter negative cash flows. Negative cash flow would reduce the System Surplus Buffer, and if necessary, The Maker Protocol may need to mint MKR to cover any shortfall.

By setting the Dai Savings Rate to 0%, Maker Governance can effectively turn off the DSR contract.

## Considerations
When DAI holders deposit DAI to the DSR contract, interest is paid from accrued stability fees. Therefore, increasing the Dai Savings Rate will cause the System Surplus Buffer to fill more slowly and reduce the amount of Dai available for FLAP auctions. If the Dai Savings Rate is set too high, the Maker Protocol could have negative cash flow and eventually need to print MKR.

Maker Governance should recognise that a negative interest rate will not work as intended as balances within the Dai Savings Rate cannot decrease.

Any changes to the Dai Savings Rate may affect PSM usage behaviour. For example, increased upward pressure on the Peg caused by the DSR may require increased PSM usage to balance.

In the event of an Emergency Shutdown, the Dai Savings Rate will be set to 0% to prevent the total debt of the Maker Protocol from increasing.
