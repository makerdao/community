Translations can present a challenge. But not if you're [Maximum Crash](https://github.com/MaximumCrash). Our philosophy is that
"content creators write the website," so the `content` folder therefore decides how the site is rendered,
_including_ translated content. However, this is an issue when translating inline UI elements that we won't
provide in MDX (like the Search bar). This means there's a break in how we can translate copy like "Search"
and "No results" into the current locale...

## Why Not i18n or another library?

i18n is a Javascript API that allows developers an easy and "lightweight" (<- we'll get to that) way of translating
textual content for a node based application. It's been great, but the reason we decided NOT to use it for this
project is because it would couple translated content with our code. This is a big no-no, as it goes against our WYSIWYG
philosophy for the `content` folder and means that content creators would have to translate text in 2 different places.

Add to this the fact that the i18n package for gatsby, and other frameworks, has a tendency to be larger than necessary.
We believe that keeping things simple will be a positive for the scale of our application. Therefore, we present:

## UseTranslation (aka MaximumLang)

Did you catch the `camlCase` joke? If you did, kudos you're a super nerd too.

useTranslation is a hook developed by Réjon Taylor-Foster with inspiration from and reference to
[this blog](https://w11i.me/how-to-build-multilingual-website-in-next-js). It initializes
inside functional components and exports the current site's locale, and a `t` function.

### How to translate in code

If your `en/UI.json` looks like this:

```json:title=en/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Language": "English",
    "Search": "Search",
    "No_Results": "No results for '{{searchText}}'",
    "Home": "Home"
  }
}
```

Accomplish translating and rendering the word "Search" by writing the following:

```js:title=component-example.js
import useTranslation from "@modules/localization/useTranslation";

const ComponentExample = () => {
  const { locale, t } = useTranslation();

  return <p>{t("Search")}</p>;
};
```

### LangSpaces

We can extend the capabilities of this simple `t` function with what we call LangSpaces (Language Space):

```json:title=en/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Language": "English",
    "Search": "Search",
    "No_Results": "No results for '{{searchText}}'",
    "Home": "Home",
    "Errors": {
      "error_a": "This is an error inside of a langspace called Errors"
    }
  }
}
```

to translate and render "error_a", write the following:

```js:title=component-langspace-example.js
import useTranslation from "@modules/localization/useTranslation";

const ComponentExample = () => {
  const { locale, t } = useTranslation();

  return <p>{t("error_a", "Errors")}</p>;
};
```

For the sake of quality of life, it's possible to pass in a default lang space for your current translation as well:

```js:title=component-langspace-default-example.js
import useTranslation from "@modules/localization/useTranslation";

const ComponentExample = () => {
  const { locale, t } = useTranslation("Errors"); //<- Notice

  return (
    <p>{t("error_a")}</p> //<- Notice
  );
};
```

### Variables and Plurals

You want the variable of counter included and with plurals? No problem, anything inside `{{}}` will be replaced when rendered:

```json:title=en/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Friend": "A Friend",
    "Friend_plural": "{{count}} Friends",
    "VariableExample": "My name is {{name}}"
  }
}
```

```js:title=variable-component-example.js
import useTranslation from '@modules/localization/useTranslation'

const ComponentExample = () => {
   const {locale, t} = useTranslation();

  return (
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 0})}</p> //0 Friends
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 1})}</p> //Friend
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 2})}</p> //2 Friends, ect.
       <p>{t("VariableExample", null, {name: "Réjon"})}</p> // My name is Réjon
   )
}
```

### Advanced Plurals

Because different locales can have multiple plurals, and different ways of counting (ie. Arabic),
we have a system in place to handle counting differently if the strict variable is added to the `t` function like so:
`t('Friend', null, {count: 1, strict: true})`. NOTE: `Friend` and `Friend_plural` are still valid, but will be overridden when a strict argument is provided to the variable(s).

Your json will look like:

```json:title=en/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Friend": "A Friend",
    "Friend_plural": "{{count}} Friends",
    "Friend_0": "No Friends",
    "Friend_1": "A Friend",
    "Friend_2": "Two Friends",
    "Friend_3": "Few Friends",
    "Friend_4": "Many Friends",
    "Friend_5": "Other/Lots of Friends"
  }
}
```

Your output will look something like this:

```js:title=advanced-variable-example.js
import useTranslation from '@modules/localization/useTranslation'

const ComponentExample = () => {
   const {locale, t} = useTranslation();

  return (
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 0, strict: true})}</p> //No Friends (key: Friend_0)
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 1, strict: true})}</p> //A Friend (key: Friend_1)
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 2, strict: true})}</p> //Two Friends (key: Friend_2)
       <p>{t("Friend", null, {count: 5, strict: true})}</p> //Other/Lots of Friends (key: Friend_5)
   )
}
```

<CTA>


NOTE: If your count goes past 4 or is less than 0, it will default to key_5

</CTA>


### Getting a localized string from another locale

Let's say you're currently on the English locale, but you need a string from the French locale,
but also want to keep your current locale. Say no more fam:

```json:title=en/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Language": "English"
  }
}
```

```json:title=fr/UI.json
{
  "UI": {
    "Language": "Français"
  }
}
```

```js:title=multilang-example.js
import useTranslation from '@modules/localization/useTranslation'

const ComponentExample = () => {
   const {locale, t} = useTranslation(); //Current locale is "en"

  return (
       <p>{t("Language")}</p> //English
       <p>{t("Language",null,null,'fr')}</p> //Français
   )
}
```

These are just examples, for an in-depth dive on how the function works see the [comments in code](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/r2d/src/modules/localization/useTranslation.js)
