Maker Vaults are digital wallets that let people deposit assets into a smart contract and use those assets as collateral to mint and loan themselves Dai.

Dai is a form of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. whose value is pegged to the US Dollar

Giving people the ability to mint and destroy Dai using permissionless technologies makes the Maker Protocol a powerful, decentralized financial service.

People often mint Dai to reinvest in digital assets but Dai is also used for things like [retail purchases](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/funding/merchant-directory) and [payroll processing](https://request.network/en/customer-stories/makerdao/).

On the surface, a vault may seem no more complicated than a simple loan, but it's important to understand how vaults work to get the most value out of them and avoid having your collateral liquidated.

When you're ready to create your own vault, head over to the [Oasis App](https://oasis.app/) to get started. Until then, here are some great resources for learning about Maker Vaults.

## #5 Open a Multi-Collateral Vault with MakerDAO from MyEtherWallet (MEW)

This resource from MyEtherWallet is unique in that it's the only tutorial in our list that teaches you how to create a Maker Vault using something other than the [Oasis App](https://oasis.app/) offered by MakerDAO.

Instead, MyEtherWallet offers a dApp browser with a dApp that gives users to access the same functions as Oasis.

Vaults can be moved between these interfaces by migrating the wallet used to create the vault but doing so will require care to ensure the wallet doesn't get lost or exposed in the process.
