## Welcome the first edition of the Humans of MakerDAO!

Humans of MakerDAO will be released bi-weekly to profile the amazing individuals responsible for the continued growth of MakerDAO.

Working for a DAO has been a life-changing opportunity for me, and I’m energized by this team’s commitment to extend that opportunity to others. 

While many struggle with the question of how to define a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), DAOs are the same as any organization in that they're defined by the people responsible for bringing them to life and nurturing the community surrounding them.

This edition of Humans of MakerDAO profiles four members of the Community Development team, and in the future, we'll branch out to highlight stakeholders and contributors from throughout the Maker ecosystem.

MakerDAO has one of the most talented and capable teams I’ve had the privilege of working with, so without further ado, I’m proud to present the Humans of MakerDAO!
