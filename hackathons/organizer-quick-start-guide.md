Welcome to the MakerDAO Quick Start Guide for Hackathon Organizers. Below you will find all the information you need to know before reaching out to us.

## Hackathon Funding Requirements

If you would like to have MakerDAO sponsor your hackathon, please have a look at the following checklist and make sure this information is included when you reach out to us at hackathons@makerdao.com.

Please reach out to us no later than two weeks before the event.

**Priority will be given to hackathons with very conservative sponsorship requirements, that allow us to create long term relationships with developers, and to promote new talent within the MakerDAO community.**
