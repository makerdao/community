## Learn about Distributed Ledger Technology

</Box>

</InfoBlock>

Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT).

By distributing data across a network of computers, DLT allows any group of individuals to maintain a public, auditable ledger of cryptographically-secured transactions.

The result is a system capable of transforming global financial and organizational structures to better serve the public good.

Blockchain technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to fix some of the systemic issues stemming from centralized power in financial systems and on the Internet.

## Types of Blockchains

Distributed ledgers can be categorized as either public or private and permissioned or permissionless.
