# The MakerDAO Community Art Contest (2021)

It is with great pleasure that we announce the MakerDAO Community Art Contest! The present is about the future and the future is here in the form of Decentralized Finance.

What began as a handful of ideas has grown into a $237 billion dollar industry in just a decade. This growth has expanded into the creative sector as well, allowing many creative professionals to earn a living on their own terms. 

The purpose of this contest is to introduce visual artists and designers to the world of Decentralized Finance and to provide information about opportunities with the potential to secure a better future for everyone!

## Contest Theme

Choose one of the [Core Principles of Maker Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO/core-principles/) and create a visual artwork to represent your chosen principle. 

We encourage you to make creative use of the MakerDAO or Dai logo in your artwork. You can use one [here](https://www.notion.so/Maker-Brand-ac517c82ff9a43089d0db5bb2ee045a4) or make your own.
