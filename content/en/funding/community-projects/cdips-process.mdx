# The CDIP Process

Here’s an outline of how self-directed projects move from _idea_ to _approval_ to _execution_ to _delivery_. We've added some helpful resources to get you started.

At a high level, there is a [visual representation](/funding/community-projects/cdips-visual/) of the current process. Reach out to us on the community chat if you want to know more about submitting a community project idea.

## Process

## Write a Proposal From Our Template

A proposal should combine the suggested ideas and skills to improve resources for the MakerDAO community. Use this Google Doc template to structure the proposal so that information is clear and milestones are defined. Outline anything you need in your proposal, there are prompts in the template.

## Engage With Feedback

An Adviser will reach out to help you through the next steps.

The Approving Group will reach out to the proposal owner and provide feedback. You’ll work on the scope, budget, resources, and timeline. The Approving Group discusses which proposals will get funding and which need more clarification bimonthly.

## Wait for a Decision

Depending on reviews and feedback you will be approved to start work or the project will be archived. Either status is communicated to the lead with relevant concerns.

</Box>


<Box>


## Start Work if approved

If it’s a small or medium scoped project, and you’ve addressed any feedback, work can begin.

For large projects, split proposals into GitHub issues/tasks. Another call with the approving group is needed to confirm the costs and resources.

</Box>


<Box>


## Communicate Progress

All projects will have checkpoints. You should expect to present progress at Community weekly sync meetings.

<Box>


## Evaluate at a Retrospective

Upon completion, there is a review process. Share the work and discuss what went well, as well as what can be improved.
