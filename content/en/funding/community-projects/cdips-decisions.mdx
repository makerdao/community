# Funding a CDIP

## What the CDIP Committee Looks For

- Roadmap: Clear scope, milestones, timeline, and a path to delivery
- Duration: Reasonable amount of time to complete the proposal
- Budget: Below 5K DAI
- Purpose: Clear impact on community growth, team, operations improvements, or workflow improvements
- Research: Some research upfront on feasibility to help the clarity of the plan

## Current CDIP Decision Process

<Checklist>


Adviser meeting complete, and table on second page complete

Committee meets to determine if the impact is clear, and the ROI is defined

Feedback is shared, if not approved, as well as the next steps for approval.

Improvements shared and check-ins scheduled, if accepted

The Adviser adds status updates and tags the GitHub issue

</Checklist>


## Evaluative Questions

<Checklist>


Feasibility (Do the qualifications match the bandwidth?)

Dependencies (Does this block anyone or other projects? )

Flextime/Slack (What does this budget look like at 3x the amount? Where are the scope creep risks?)

Feedback (Is there feedback already or does it need more?)

Promotion/Sharing (Plan for telling the community about the finished plan?)

Additional Resources (Can we route additional people to the proposal?)

Maintenance costs (Is there a plan to maintain or hand off maintenance?)

Skills (Does the contributor have a portfolio to cross-reference or demonstrate skills relevant to CDIP?)

Realistic (Are the plans expedient?)

</Checklist>


## Quick Heuristics

- A simple set of deliverables: one or two items. A supplemental presentation, or an MVP of a technical product wrapped into a realistic timeline is also great.
- The budget is clear upfront; think defined number for set hours, try to avoid ranges.

## Possible Blockers & Ways to Help

- Longer than a three-month timeline: clarify milestones and how long they will take
- More than five hours of research is necessary to complete the idea phase: the idea may not be clear enough.
- Too many web3 interactions or protocol dependencies: a hackathon may be a better format.
