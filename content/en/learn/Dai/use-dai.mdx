# Use Dai

<Box sx={{ padding: 4 }}>


Use Dai to save, lend, borrow, give to charity, make investments, cover business expenses, or buy goods and services.

_Note_: Spending and using Dai means using a Dai-friendly wallet to store, send, and receive Dai, so make sure to brush up on [wallets](/learn/blockchain-fundamentals/wallets/).

## Dai as Money

### Transfer Value

Send Dai to friends, acquaintances, enemies, and relatives. Dai can be sent internationally to transfer value across borders in minutes rather than days while skipping the middlemen, exchange rates, wire fees, and questions.

## Spend Dai

#### Give to Charity

A great way to spend Dai? Donate it to charity! Lots of charities already accept cryptocurrency donations, and many find Dai to be the most convenient.

Since it's soft-pegged to the US dollar, there's no rush to escape volatility by converting it to another asset.
