# Poll: Adjust the BAT-A Debt Ceiling - September 21, 2020.md

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition for a **BAT Debt Ceiling** increase from 5 million Dai to 10 million Dai.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 21 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, September 25, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **BAT Debt Ceiling** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-the-bat-debt-ceiling/3919) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If the Friday executive passes, then this debt ceiling change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
