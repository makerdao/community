## Poll Exercise 3 Responses

Here are the actions I would take:

1. First, I would validate the text of the standing order to ensure it aligns with Maker's principles, even if some ambiguities exist. I would also take proactive steps to resolve the ambiguity in the text of the standing order by reaching out to Emilia privately to discuss further on Friday
2. Next, I would recognize MagicRWA's proposal with a forum response and note that it will be placed in a weekly poll for community consideration, given the significance of the changes and their implications.
3. I would select the template for the poll and determine its contents which includes a summary of the proposal, voting choices, and links to relevant resources for voters to make informed decisions. I would also include a note on the invalidation of the current standing order related to ALM transfers to maintain the DAI peg at the time of writing if this poll is ratified and the executive vote passes
4. I will review the poll drafts against the 'poll creation checklist' to ensure they meet all criteria. Additionally, I will carefully check for any spelling or grammatical errors and make sure the language used is easy to understand.
5. I would then create a draft PR to the repo and request reviews of the poll content from other facilitators
6. Using any feedback and notes from reviewers, I will finalise the poll and review it against the 'poll submission checklist', adding all relevant tags based on the potential impact of the proposed changes and their appropriate categories. In this case, relevant tags would include "high-impact" and "RWA" before making a PR to push final changes to the main repo branch.
7. Once the polls are active I would start comms across all relevant channels including governance channels in the MakerDAO Discord, and within the original forum thread itself, for the sake of visibility and awareness. I would continue to monitor these channels and respond to any questions and concerns, especially considering the importance of maintaining the DAI peg and the role RWAs play in Maker's collateral system.



**Forum Response:**

Hello, @Emilia and Maker community,

Thank you for bringing forth the request regarding changes to the standing order for MagicRWA. I appreciate MagicRWA's proactive approach in gathering community sentiment on the ALM structure via forum poll. We've reviewed the text of the proposed order and will initiate a governance poll on Monday, as requested, to validate the proposed standing order changes to the trust relating to the transfer of RWA revenues from vaults arranged by MagicRWA. If this standing order is approved, it will result in the return of MagicRWA vault revenues from the trust through the conduit and jar contract on a quarterly basis.

In line with @Faraz's note, our advisory teams will review the feedback from the community and subsequently post their insights and recommendations on the ALM structure. 

To all MKR token holders, we urge you to review the standing order text carefully and partake in the governance poll. 

I will continue to update this thread as the proposal advances through the governance process

Thank you!
