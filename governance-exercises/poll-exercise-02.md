# Polling Exericse #2

## Background

Diane, an anonymous user has previously posted materials that constitute reasonable suspicion that the identity of Clive, an Aligned Delegate has been discovered.

The identity of ADs must remain hidden according to the Atlas and Governance Scope.

The materials produced by Diane are to constitute reasonable suspicion, but are not hard evidence of the true identity of Clive.

## Dramatis Personae

* You (Governance Facilitator)
* Clive (Aligned Delegate)
* Diane (AD Doxxer)

### Clive Derecognition Poll
```
Author: You
Date: Monday 24th July 2023
```

Given the requirements of the Atlas and Governance Scope [link to relevant scopes], and the materials [link to materials] posted publicly by Diane relating to Clive, we will be putting up a poll asking governance to rule on the derecognition of Clive.

We would like to discourage public speculation in this thread.

If anyone _privately_ presents us with concrete evidence that Clive’s identity is compromised prior to the poll date, we will confirm with Clive, and communicate this outcome publicly while keeping the materials private. In this case, the poll will not be required.

I want to just make clear that I consider Diane to be trolling, and that none of the presented materials are remotely correct. They made a faulty assumption early on that a transfer to and from and exchange were to wallets both belonging to me. I’ve gone into more detail on the other thread regarding this.

I don’t think this even warrants a poll, and the idea that this is ‘reasonable suspicion’ is bullshit. Frankly, it makes me doubt @You’s judgement on other recent governance matters.

Not my fault you have bad op-sec, @Clive. Spin up a new identity and do it better in the future.

I would also like to understand the bounty process @You. I’m expecting payout to be covered as part of this poll. Is this correct?

The system that provides bounties for doxxing like this is immoral, and arguably illegal in many jurisdictions. I would call on AVCs to clarify the behaviour of the scope here as soon as practicably possible. I would be happy to lead or support any efforts in this direction (assuming I’m still an AD.)
