**12.1.1:**

Do you think there is any ambiguity in these clauses? If so, where, and how would you rewrite the clauses to remove the ambiguity?

How would you interpret these clauses as-they-are in the following situations? Would you allow votes to take place? What would be the contents of these votes?

**Situation A**

Aligned Delegates are not being compensated due to a clear typo elsewhere in the Governance Scope.

**Situation B**

A large token holder wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

**Situation C**

An anonymous account wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

**Situation D**

As a consequence of a significant reduction in Aligned Delegate pay, all Aligned Delegates step down from the position.

## Response

Your resonse should include:
* Brief description of any ambiguity you can identify in these clauses.
* A rewrite of the clauses, if you feel it is required.
* For each situation:
    * A brief description of how you would interpret the relevant clauses given the situation.
    * A brief description of how you would respond as Governance Facilitator. Votes, forum posts, etc. 

Please don't draft other materials like polls or forum posts fully. I'm only looking for a summary of your response in these situations.
