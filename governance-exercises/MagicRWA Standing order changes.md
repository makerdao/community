# Poll: MagicRWA Standing Order Changes - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 31 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following change:
* Approve a standing order change to the trust relating to the transfer of RWA revenues from vaults arranged by MagicRWA.
  - This proposed change means that MagicRWA vault revenues will be returned quarterly via the conduit and jar contract from the trust.

 The standing order can be viewed [here](link to standing order text on Pinata)

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/txxx) to help inform your position before voting.

**Note**: The existing standing order for the MagicRWA vault trust related to ALM transfers to maintain the DAI peg is invalidated as a result of this standing order. The ALM order will be replaced shortly once the new version has been fully drafted. A forum [poll](link to forum poll) has been created to help judge community sentiment on the logic for the replacement ALM order.


## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This standing order change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
