# StableLab Polling Exercise Responses 

## 1: Determine what course of action you would take as a Governance Facilitator and communicate it clearly

- I would first review the proposal thoroughly and perform any necessary compliance checks
- I would then reach out to Alice and Faraz if any outstanding details or further clarification are needed to determine what polls should be drafted. In this case, the proposal provides all details required with a few
- Based on Maker's governance cycles as detailed [here](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle), I would assess the suitability of the proposal's polls for either the Weekly or Monthly Governance cycle. Since the proposal author has emphasized the time-sensitivity of the matter, citing their user base's rapid growth trajectory and the need to capitalize on this growth, I would opt to include these polls in the Weekly cycle.
- Since Bob has already given authorization via forum post for these Spork-related polls, I would then determine how to split these polls so that users are allowed to express their opinions separately.
- While these actions are closely linked, I would split them into two separate polls to clearly distinguish between the distinct proposed changes.
  
  ### Adjust Spork Protocol D3M Parameters and DAI Interest Rate - July 24, 2023:
  - Increase Spork D3M Debt Ceiling by 50 million from 50 million to 100 million DAI.
  - Increase Spork D3M Target Available Debt (gap) by 10 million from 5 million to 15 million.
  - Adjust Spork Protocol DAI Interest Rate Strategy to increase the DAI deposit rate by 0.5% from 2% to 2.5%
  - Increase the Ceiling Increase Cooldown from 28,800 seconds (8 hrs) to 86,400 seconds (24 hrs)
 
  ### Onboard $ABC to Spork Protocol - July 24, 2023
  -  Onboard the ABC to Spork with the parameters below:
	- [onboarding parameters for token $ABC]

- After determining the contents of the poll I would choose the most suitable templates which are 'Adjust $protocol_name D3M Parameters - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY.md' and 'Onboard $token to Spark Protocol - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY.md'.
- Next, I would publish a response in the forum thread informing the proposers and community of the decision to submit two polls, with rationale included.
- I would then draft the polls using the poll templates as stated above. The polls will include a summary of the proposal, voting choices, and links to relevant resources for voters to make informed decisions. I will review the poll drafts against the 'poll creation checklist' to ensure they meet all criteria. Additionally, I will carefully check for any spelling or grammatical errors and make sure the language used is easy to understand.
- I would then create a draft PR to the repo and ask for reviews of the polls content from the proposers and Bob
- Using any feedback and notes from reviewers, I will finalise the polls and review them against the 'poll submission checklist', adding all relevant tags based on impact and category. In this case, relevant tags would include "high-impact", collateral onboard" and "D3M" before making a PR to push changes to the main branch.
- Once the polls are active I would initiate comms across all relevant channels including governance channels in the MakerDAO Discord, and within the original forum thread itself, for the sake of visibility. I would continue to monitor these channels and respond to questions and concerns.

## 2: Draft any forum responses required or implied by your course of action.

## Forum Response

I'm glad to see the continued success and growth of the Spork protocol, and I appreciate the detailed proposals from both @Alice and @Faraz, as well as @Bob's approval for a governance poll.

After reviewing the recommendations and advisories regarding the requested changes, I have decided to split the proposal into two separate polls. The changes, though nonorthogonal, are quite distinct and have a significant impact, so this approach will allow voters to consider and vote on each matter independently. The two polls will be presented during the next weekly governance cycle on **Monday, July 24th**:

  ### Adjust Spork Protocol D3M Parameters and DAI Interest Rate - July 24, 2023:
  - Increase Spork D3M Debt Ceiling by 50 million from 50 million to 100 million DAI.

  - Adjust Spork Protocol DAI Interest Rate Strategy to increase the DAI deposit rate by 0.5% from 2% to 2.5%
  - Increase the Ceiling Increase Cooldown from 28,800 seconds (8 hrs) to 86,400 seconds (24 hrs)
 
  ### Onboard $ABC to Spork Protocol - July 24, 2023
  -  Onboard the ABC to Spork with the parameters below
  -  	[onboarding parameters for token $ABC]

I will continue to update this thread with relevant links and details as the proposal advances through the governance process. Thanks!
