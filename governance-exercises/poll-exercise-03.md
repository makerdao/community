# Polling Exericse #3

## Background

MagicRWA is an RWA arranger that arranges/manages a large RWA vault for Maker Core.

A standing order given to the trust (? LFW: I think it's the trust, or the director of the trust, not terribly important for the exercise), empowers them to take certain actions based on the pre-approved logic of the standing order. Think like a smart contract, only less smart, less transparent, and less reliable.  

Currently, one standing order is in force, relating to transfers from the trust to the PSMs and back depending on the amount of collateral in the PSMs.

### MagicRWA - Standing Order Change 
```

Hello, Maker. 

As discussed with large MKR governance holders recently, we are requesting authorization via poll for the following standing order, relating to the transfer of RWA revenues from vaults arranged by MagicRWA.

The wording of the standing order is shown below and has been uploaded to IPFS[link to standing order text on Pinata] via Pinata.

[Imagine the text of the Standing Order here. Should be considered internally consistent but with some ambiguities. It covers revenue return only.]

This will mean revenues will be returned via the conduit and jar contract on a quarterly basis.

The poll should take place on Monday. 

The existing standing order related to ALM transfers to maintain the DAI peg is invalidated as a result of this standing order. The ALM order will be replaced shortly once the new version has been fully drafted. 

We have included a forum poll here to help judge community sentiment of the logic for the replacement ALM order:

[LFW: Assume this is using the forum polling functionality.]
How should the ALM order be structured?

1. Trigger transfers back to PSM when PSM levels are below 10% total DAI minted. Transfers out to RWA trust at above 20% total DAI minted.
2. Trigger transfers back to PSM when PSM levels are below 15% total DAI minted. Transfers out to RWA trust at above 20% total DAI minted.
3. Trigger transfers back to PSM when PSM levels are below 20% total DAI minted. Transfers out to RWA trust at above 25% total DAI minted.
4. Something else.

Thank you, everyone.
