# Polling Exericse #4

## Background

Both Roundtable Develop and WeCodeCrypto are considered to be technical ecosystem actors that have previously contributed to MakerDAO smart contracts and the executive voting process.

Imogen and Genevieve have reached out to you privately (independently) and communicated that they believe this warrants an emergency response.

Henrik has reached out to you and has attempted to convince you that Fix A should not be offered as an option to governance.

### Urgent - MakerDAO Core Contract Exploit 
```
Author: Imogen
Date: Wednesday 9th August 2023
```

Earlier today, Roundtable Develop identified a minor exploit in a core Maker Protocol contract. We are keeping details of this exploit vague at this time for safety reasons, but we have been able to confirm the following:
* Customer funds are not at risk.
* The issue in the code is only exploitable in a limited and infrequent set of circumstances.
* The issue in the code is not exploitable under the current circumstances.
* The severity of the exploit is deemed ‘Critical’
* There is no obvious incentive to trigger the exploit beyond griefing. 

Both Roundtable Develop and WeCodeCrypto have recommended that we not disclose any additional information related to the exploit beyond the above. 

There are two avenues of action available to us, with different tradeoffs. We would like to request @You organize an urgent poll to determine how we move forward.

This exploit has two fixes.

**Fix A**

* Fix A prevents the high-severity exploit immediately upon the executive vote passing.
* Fix A is likely to incur losses to MKR holders of approximately 20 million DAI over two weeks.

**Fix B**

* Fix B closes the high-severity exploit approximately two weeks after the executive vote passes. 
* Fix B has no risk of incurring financial loss to MKR holders. 

We will include Fix B in the executive regardless, the question is whether we also include Fix A. 

RoundTable and WeCodeCrypto are divided on their opinion on how to deal with the issue. They will make comments below.

[Note, this is a spectacularly unlikely scenario in its specifics, but it makes for a useful exercise. - LFW]

I'm confirming on behalf of RoundTable Develop that the exploit exists and that we don’t recommend further disclosure at this time.

The sooner we get a decision on this the better, we’re preparing the two executives anyway, but it would be safer not to post both of them together. If we can resolve the question via the polling system before the executives are ready, that would be preferable. 

We’ll have the Fix B executive up very shortly. Although the loss is considerable, we strongly recommend governance opt to also implement Fix A.

Henrik from WeCodeCrypto here. 

We have also independently confirmed the exploit. And while we don’t believe it’s necessary to be quite so cloak and dagger about the fix, we’ve agreed not to disclose at this time. 

We do not recommend Fix A, and consider the likelihood of the exploit being identified and triggered by an outside actor extremely low. We strongly believe that governance will regret ‘spending’ 20 million DAI on peace of mind once the details and severity of the exploit are fully revealed.

We would also like to formally request that we be allowed review sign-off on the executive spells RoundTable is preparing.

No. You’ve done enough. Review them and post whatever you like, we’re not delaying deployment waiting for you to sign off.
