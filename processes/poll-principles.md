# Poll Principles

## Clarity

As the entity responsible for an individual governance poll, you must ensure:
* That the outcomes of the governance poll are as clear as possible regardless of which option is victorious.
* That the method for counting votes is clearly understood by voters.
* That voters understand how they should vote to accurately express their preferences.
* That the process that has led to the poll being submitted to governance is as transparent and easily understood as possible.
* That the identity (can be pseudonymous) of the entity responsible for publishing the poll is as transparent as possible. 
* That the identity (can be pseudonymous) of the entity responsible for triggering the poll is as transparent as possible. 

The overriding goal of ensuring this level of clarity is to increase the legitimacy of the outcome of the poll to the point where it cannot reasonably be questioned on grounds of an invalid process. 

Given any individual poll, some voters are likely to be unhappy with the outcome. And given any individual poll, some voters are likely to be unhappy with the governance process that led to the poll. Both of these outcomes are expected to some extent. What must be avoided to the cost of almost everything else is voter unhappiness with the _execution_ of the governance process. 

Governance must be able to trust that the process is executed impartially and without bias towards specific or general outcomes. Any mistake in following the governance process erodes this trust. Intentional deviation from the governance process erodes this trust further. 

If this trust is eroded too far, it renders all decisions made under the purview of that facilitator suspect. In this situation, governance will rightly feel disenfranchised by the facilitator and will likely seek their replacement.

## Informed Voters

As the entity responsible for an individual governance poll, you must ensure that voters have access to sufficient information to make an informed vote. This might include:
* Links to any documentation or discussion regarding the proposal that is up for vote.
* A summary of the proposal created by an unbiased and knowledgeable third party.
* Links to any analysis that has been published by DAO-funded entities regarding the proposal that is up for a vote.
* Links to well-maintained resources describing the nature of any parameters that may be changed if the proposal is actioned.

The overriding goal of ensuring easy access to relevant information is to increase the legitimacy of the outcome of the poll to the point where it cannot reasonably be questioned on the grounds of a lack of knowledge held by voters. 

There should never be a situation in which a significant portion of the voters are confused about the impact of a successful proposal. 

It is also extremely important that this principle is maintained for the benefit of outside observers. Users of the protocol can also be affected by the outcomes of proposals, and cannot be expected to have the same level of context and knowledge about the inner workings of the Maker protocol as regular voters or delegates.
