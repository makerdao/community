# Endgame Interpretation Principles

## Clarity vs. Ambiguity

Your greatest enemy within any sort of 'DAO legal document' such as the Atlas, Scopes, or MIPs before them is the issue of ambiguity or outright contradiction in the wording of clauses. 

This issue can readily occur:
* Either within a single clause.
* Across multiple clauses in the same hierarchy.
* Across multiple documents.

**Within a Single Clause**

Within a single clause, the issue usually arises from either imprecise use of language or the inclusion of 'persuasive' language when statements should be entirely declarative. As general rules:
* Encourage the use of precise language.
* Discourage inclusion of anything but declarative statements that directly relate to the rules. 

**Across multiple clauses in the same hierarchy**

The issue when multiple clauses are involved usually stems from a lack of proofreading of the final version of the document. It's very easy to introduce this issue when making revisions to such documents. It can also occur when logic 'spreads' out of the clauses it should be confined to, and is added to surrounding clauses. As general rules:
* Encourage authors and reviewers to proofread any documents.
* Encourage authors to take special care when working on multiple versions of the same document. 

**Across multiple documents**

The issue when multiple documents are involved can also be caused by a lack of proof-reading, however, it can also result from a lack of knowledge of the contents of existing documents by the author making changes. As general rules:
* Encourage authors to refamiliarize themselves with all the relevant documents when preparing to propose changes.
* Encourage authors and reviewers to proofread any documents.

### How to interpret contradictions and ambiguity?

Assuming you don't have a time machine, and can't make the author do a better job when they created the document in question, you will need to deal with the issue of explicit contradictions. There are a few ways of dealing with this:

**Interpret to your best judgment of the author's intent**
_Figure out what the author meant and interpret in favor of that intention._

* Requires that you have a solid understanding of the author's intent. 
	* The author may not remember their intent at the time of interpretation.
	* The author may lie about their intent at the time of interpretation.
	* The author may not be available to consult.
* Can result in more 'accurate' interpretations. 

Generally speaking, I don't recommend this approach. It's too variable and requires you to rely on the author's memory, intentions, and honesty. 

**Interpret to your best judgment of the wording**
_Figure out what the 'most natural' interpretation is given all the relevant text._

* Requires you to take the external view and approach wording from that position. 
* You can actually go and ask people, but they need to be people you are sure have no stake in the outcome of the interpretation.
* However, this often amplifies the negative impacts of badly written documents. 
* Doesn't rely on what the author claims to have meant when writing.

I would describe this as the most 'pure' and correct approach to take in the interpretation role. However, it is also an approach that can easily result in tangible and concrete harm to the project and/or the people involved in it. 

**Interpret to your best judgment of rationality**
_Figure out the 'most rational' interpretation of the intent, given all the relevant text._

* Requires you to be able to think rationally, at least to a limited degree.
* This approach can vary wildly depending on the ambiguity/contradiction in question.
* Relies on the content of ratified documents as a whole being broad-speaking rational. 
* Will usually lead to reasonable outcomes.
* Doesn't rely on what the author claims to have meant when writing.

In a general context, this would be a great approach. However, I believe that much of the content of the current set of 'DAO legal documents' is fundamentally irrational. This means that interpretations under this approach will likely conflict violently with what the document's author intended. 

**Interpret to your best judgment of what the majority of governance wants**
_Figure out what governance actually wants to happen in this situation, and interpret in favor of that._

* In some cases, documents are meant to constrain future governance decisions and actions. This breaks if you interpret with this approach. 
* Ultimately makes you obsolete, if all interpretation matches governance's preferred outcome, there is no reason to pay someone to make interpretations.
* Requires you to make an estimation of what the majority of governance wants.
* Doesn't rely on what the author claims to have meant when writing.

In my opinion, this is a bad approach to take to interpreting 'DAO legal documents'. It means that ultimately these documents don't matter, and are largely performative. If you will just always break them if governance wants to do so, then ratification means nothing, and governance has no credibility.
