# Community Development at Maker

The Community Development group's mandate is to directly foster the growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem by incentivizing our most motivated members. We do this through a series of initiatives that encourage people to participate in, and contribute to, the success of the Dai Stablecoin platform.

## Our Initiatives

### [Community Meetup Grants](meetups.md)

Community members play an invaluable role in building a stronger MakerDAO ecosystem. The Community Development Group wants to provide the resources needed to increase Dai adoption and help MakerDAO bring stability and financial inclusion to the world. To accomplish these goals, we created a 'Do It Yourself' Meetup guide and microgranting program dedicated to helping anyone create and organize a local community meetup.

### [Community Translations](translations.md)

We bring MakerDAO educational content to people around the world in their native languages by incentivizing our community translators with Dai bounties.

### [Development Grants Program](grants.md)

The MakerDAO Community grants program provides funding for projects that increase Dai adoption, support emerging economies, open new markets, provide novel uses for the stablecoin, or otherwise further the principles of the MakerDAO Foundation.

### [Hackathons and Bounties](hackathons.md)

MakerDAO participates in a number of Hackathons every year. This section contains some information about how to request our participation in an upcoming event.

### [Contributing](contributing.md)

If you have any suggestions about how you think these initiatives should work, could be improved, or if you are interested in helping out, please join our [#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development) channel and introduce yourself.
