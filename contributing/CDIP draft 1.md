# CDIP Explainer

## What is a CDIP?

CDIP stands for Community Development Initiative Proposal. Everyone in MakerDAO can be a contributor, and the CDIP is a scoping and framing process to propose new initiative ideas and make them a reality. Ideas can include brand new initiatives and/or expand the scope of existing initiatives. A proposal combines your ideas, skills, and abilities with our shared goal of improving the MakerDAO community and its resources. Each CDIP is begun by a community member, shared with the contributor community for feedback, and is shepherded through an approval process by a dedicated person. Once approved, work can be started on the new or expanded initiative.

## Where Does One Start A CDIP

We use this [CDIP template doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lF8mNuomrguIS3lnvqTomS4NdON40nuyKRbLS6ZkMoA/edit?usp=sharing) to start and expand the process of your ideas. To submit a CDIP, simply make a copy of the template, fill out the first page (step 1), and post the doc-link in our group chat (#[Commdev](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)). A shepherd will reach out to review further.

## How do CDIP’s proceed?

To help see the big picture, below is a workflow of our current process. Contributor steps are highlighted in green. Meetings/updates, held with MakerDAO Community Development, are highlighted in purple. Finally, note the Foundation’s operations highlighted in orange. CDIP owners are expected to refine, approve, scope, and assist your CDIP towards completion.

## What happens if scoped work can’t be completed?

Title the project: “inactive,” comment and @ team members in the doc, and DM the shepherd.

How does someone contribute to an open CDIP?
If you’re an editor, writer, developer, designer, translator, or just want to provide feedback we can likely source a CDIP to contribute to. SHare a link to the relevant github task in our COmm_Dev chat.

## What and who is the “Committee”?

The committee is Foundation employees and senior contributors of the community.

## Do’s and Dont’s

### Yes

- Have ideas, lots of them. Be proactive in communicating, especially clarifying.
- Be open to feedback, and seek it. Comments in google docs are spectacular ways to clarify what might be missing, or phrasing that might need elaboration.
- Leverage colleagues, organizations, dashboards, and available Maker resources. Other teams are more than welcome to come in and help build community.
- If you want broader feedback, share the CDIP around as much as you can beyond rocketchat ( e.g., Maker’s forum, Reddit, Twitter). Advocating for improvement in the open is preferred. Just make the CDIP view only to external contributors.
- We prefer scoping work on ideas, together. Expect 1-3 hours of time to frame and flesh out an idea, before paid, scoping work begins. We don’t want contributors overworking to create. Every contributor should be and will be paid for work that’s in scope.
- Follow Maker’s Writing Style Guide and Editor/Contributor Guide (link)

### No

- Please don’t do too much work to validate an idea and then bill Maker for completed work. Keep ideas light, yet thoughtful in scope at first. The idea is to deliver exactly what was imagined or under budget.
  - Conservative budgets are more likely to be funded. Scoping ridiculous amounts of work off the bat (+30 hours?) might not be necessary.
- If you hit $1000 in costs reach out sooner than later. You just might have a large project on your hands. That needs extra eyes so you don’t burn out.
- A CDIP isn’t always necessary. If there is about five hours of clear, delineated work to do on a certain design, or a really clear github issue to complete, we won’t need this whole process. Cut and dry work should be straightforward enough, just reach out in the chat.
- Limit CDIPs to 3 at a time.
